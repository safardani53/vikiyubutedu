After all, you never know when you'll need a recommendation from someone within the organization — not to mention, future employers can contact pretty much anyone they want from your job history, whether you've listed them as a reference or not.</p><p>These 15 people definitely didn't heed that sage career advice, but as lacking as their resignations are in tact and decorum they more than make up for in chutzpah and laughs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These shoes were made for walking</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Sometimes a bad boss can push you to your limit, but it's rare for all the staff to reach that breaking point at the same time. From the looks of things, these three retail employees had it with their abusive boss and made it known by quitting together and leaving the store closed for business along with the following note:</p>"Dear Jamie, Since you decided to say "cancer is not an excuse" and think it's OK to swear at your employees like you do ALL the time... WE QUIT. THIS is why you can't keep a store manager longer than a year. YOU ABUSE your roll [sic[ and staff. Enjoy the fact that you lost a store manager, co-manager, and key holder in the middle of back to school. Think next time you treat people the way you do. We aren't allowing it anymore. Niki, Jess, TJ."<p>You had me at "cancer is not an excuse," Niki, Jess and TJ.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Parting is such sweet fondant.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Now this is one way to sugarcoat your resignation. Chris Holmes decided his true passion was in baking, and we think he's got a real future in it, judging from his notice. Impeccably hand-lettered in icing on pristine white fondant, the letter is actually very police and otherwise professional. "I wish the organisation and my colleagues the best for the future and I remind you that, if you enjoy this cake, you can order more at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.mrcake.co.uk</a>," he concludes the message.</p><p>Judging from his site, it was the right career move.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This cake tastes bitter.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This cake isn't quite as nice as Chris's. Not only is it clearly store-bought — not classy, bro —but the message is slightly less heartfelt. It reads, "#?!@ ya'll [sic] I quit!"&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He seemed like such a nice guy, too.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In 1974, Ted Bundy worked at the Washington Department of Emergency (where he met his future wife and possible mother of his daughter, <a href=#>Carol Boone</a>), but he quit to pursue law school (and also to kill a bunch more women in Colorado, Utah, and eventually Florida). Here is the letter with which he tendered his resignation, and he truly has the handwriting of a serial killer.&nbsp;</p><p>"It is with some regret, not much, but some regret that I submit this my final resignation. Try to persuade me to stay. Bribe me. Slash my tires. But the world needs me, " he writes. Did it, Ted?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Something tells me that's not his contact info...</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Andrew here not only knows how to burn a bridge but keep it succinct. In this pithy little message memo, he informs "The boss" that Andrew (ex-employee) is quitting as of 3 p.m. with the following message. "You are a drunken pig with no foresight or business acumen. I hope you die in a house fire. F--k you I quit." The best part is the email and phone number he provided: 1-800-KISS-MY-A** and smokec**k@yourexpense.com.</p><p>You kiss your mom with that mouth, Andrew?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Say it with Kanye.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Marina Shifrin worked long hours producing video content for Next Media Animation, so it's only fitting that she tendered her resignation with a video. She filmed herself in the otherwise empty office at 4:30 a.m. dancing to Kanye West's "Gone" while explaining why she was leaving. Frustrated with the long hours and a focus on quantity of views over quality of content, Marina decided it was time to move on to greener pastures. Her employers responded to the viral video with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of their own</a>, declaring that they were hiring.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Be nice to the marquee guy...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>As a rule, bosses should treat all their employees with respect, but judging from all the marquee resignations out there, managers would do well especially to be kind to whoever they've put in charge up updating signs like this one.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">His career is in the toilet.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Moments of clarity can occur at the strangest times and in the strangest places. For Luke here, the realization his work life was unsatisfying apparently came while on a potty break. "Though real hard as I squeezed out a big one, and realized this place is a dump," he writes. So, I'm flushing you out of my life... I quit. - Luke."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This guy's job is extinct.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"This is a drawing of a dinosaur," the note begins. &nbsp;And it is indeed a very good drawing of a dinosaur. "It is also my two weeks notice," it concludes.

So kudos to the ex-employee who drew a line in the sand and walked out on a boss that didn't have their back. "I was attacked at work by a drunk employee and my boss won't fire him because he's too lazy to work the open shift so... I quit!!!" they wrote on a note explaining to customers why no one was their to help them.&nbsp;</p><p>"Someone will (probably) be with you shortly.
