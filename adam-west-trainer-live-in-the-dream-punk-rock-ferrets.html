We had a good party on Bank Holiday Monday and Steve and Jolene are up this weekend, so we will keep the fun going.</p><p>“The horse has been lapping up the attention. Me? I’m quite ready to crawl back under my rock.&nbsp;</p><p>“Maybe I’ve seemed a bit unapproachable at times, with my silly hair and my ferrets, but I’ve been amazed at how much it has touched people.&nbsp;</p><p>“I spent most of the journey back down the M1 replying to people’s messages.</p><p>“The first time I actually watched the race back all the way through was on Tuesday, and I felt a bit embarrassed, to be honest.”</p><p>It might have made West, 34, cringe but it had the rest of us grinning from ear-to-ear.</p><p>The result and reaction afterwards was as refreshing as one of the crisp lagers in the crate in the corner of West’s office.</p><p>But don’t expect him to turn up at the races in a flashy new motor and a tailored Savile Row suit.</p><p>His cut of the Nunthorpe cash will be pumped straight back into the business and, if anything, help keep his head above water.&nbsp;</p><p>West said: “There’s been a rapid increase in costs which has really hit the smaller yards.&nbsp;</p><p>“Grain is much more expensive because of the war in Ukraine so a bag of feed, which used to be about £8, is now £28.&nbsp;</p><p>“A horse will get through one bag of feed a day and we have nearly 50 horses, so you can work it out.&nbsp;</p><p>“We are in Surrey so the rent is very high, we charge our owners a competitive going rate for this area but we can’t charge the same as the big Newmarket yards with their international owners.</p><p>“Our owners are mostly local people, and it can cost them between £10,000 and £20,000 per year, yet their horse might be racing for £3,000. It is hard to make it work.</p><p>“People say, ‘oh you’ve won a Group 1, you’re rich now’, but no way.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ll use the money to make life a bit nicer for the lads, we can get some new equipment and patch up the yard.</p><p>“The money goes down in a pyramid, the horses, feed, and staff come first - I’m at the very bottom! This just gives us the air to go again.”</p><p>Such were the sacrifices nice guy West made when he started out, he even slept on the floor of the stable office for a few months.</p><p>He opted to let his guests use the flat at the yard and made do with a blow-up bed - anything to further the business.</p><p>He joked: “If I was from a traditional racing family, I’m sure I would have gone and stayed with mother, or maybe in a different wing of the house!”</p><p>One thing is for sure, there is nothing traditional&nbsp;about West.</p><p>If he’s not unwinding with his beloved ferrets, he’ll be blowing off steam at a punk concert in London.</p><p>He’s definitely got the perfect head of hair for an evening’s head-banging, though the can of hairspray by his computer suggests he is trying to keep it under control during work hours.</p><p>And he’s a vegetarian - words that might shock some of Flat racing’s old school: “If someone put a plate of sausages in front of me it would make me sick.</p><p>“I love animals, I want nothing more than for them to live long, healthy, happy lives.</p><p>“Our ferrets aren’t working animals, but it is their instinct to go exploring down rabbit holes and it’s an old countryside pursuit, which I want to keep alive.</p><p>“They are great pets, I think people misunderstand them. We have four, they are litter-trained and can be very affectionate.</p><p>“I like going to punk concerts, too, I’m probably as far away from a stereotypical trainer as you can be.&nbsp;</p><p>“Living your own life and being yourself is important, you need to have an escape from racing.”</p><p>And where better to let down your impressive head of hair after a long season than in California.</p><p>Admittedly, his focus while he is there will be on Live In The Dream ahead of the Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint at Santa Anita on November 4.</p><p>But the delights of Los Angeles - and its miles of beautiful beaches - are on your doorstep.&nbsp;</p><p>As work trips go, it’s not a bad one. Now it’s a case of getting the horse there.</p><p>He said: “There is a race at Keeneland in October that is on my radar as a prep.</p><p>“I was at the Arc in Paris on a jolly last year and it didn’t stop raining, so if the ground was like that I couldn’t run him in the Abbaye.</p><p>“He has an entry in that but it was a begrudging entry, if I can make America work I will but it’s up to his owners.&nbsp;</p><p>“Let’s just hope we can get him there because it really would be a dream come true.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“The Americans have been great, they were straight on the phone to congratulate us, they send a huge bouquet of flowers, I think they are as excited as we are.</p><p>“But I don’t just want to win it - the five furlong track record there is around 54 seconds and I would love to shatter that."</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
