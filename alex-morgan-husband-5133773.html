And the rest of the world puts it on us. It’s less about thinking like we’re defending the last two World Cups because it’s a very different team, aside from myself and a couple of others. So it’s a really different team. And so, we have to think that with every World Cup, we’re going at it like it’s our first time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With the sport being such a huge part of Alex’s life, it was clearly kismet that she would find romance with a soccer phenom like herself. Enter <strong>Servando Carrasco</strong>, a dynamite midfielder who last played for Fort Lauderdale CF in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The pair have been going from strength to strength since they made their love connection, which included a wedding and the birth of their only child. On her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> in June 2023, Alex showed off her appreciation for Servando and her bundle of joy with a sweet photo of them playing golf and the caption, “Happy Father’s Day to the best dad to our girl and the best teammate in life I could ask for. We love you!” Let’s learn more about Alex’s biggest fan and husband, below.</p><h2>Where Is Servando From?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Servando, who was born in San Diego, California on August 13, 1988, had a portion of his childhood spent in Tijuana, Mexico. When he was seven, his family returned to the United States, and he enrolled at St. Augustine High School in San Diego, where he nurtured his love of soccer, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> MLS Soccer</a>. Following high school, Servando joined the San Diego Surf Soccer Club, renowned as one of California’s most competitive clubs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>During his time with the club, Carrasco’s soccer skills earned him several accolades, including CIF Player of the Year, Western League Player of the Year, and the San Diego Union-Tribune All-County Player of the Year, per the outlet. Additionally, he was selected for both the Olympic Development Program and the Premier Development Program.</p><h2>What Was Alex & Servando’s Meet-Cute</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>The pair first met while they were both playing soccer at the University of California, Berkeley. Alex led the Golden Bears to the N.C.A.A. Tournament consistently, while Servando was on a full scholarship and ended up making senior co-captain of the team. After graduation in 2011, Alex went to play for the Western New York Flash. Around the same time, Servando was drafted to the Seattle Sounders.</p><h2>Where Did They Get Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Alex and Servando were long-distance relationship champs. They kept their love affair going early on in their romance even though they were often playing soccer in different parts of the world. In 2014, they decided to take it to the next level and got engaged, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>11 months later, the adorable athletes walked down the aisle together! They exchanged vows in front of 180 guests at Rancho Dos Pueblos in Santa Barbara, California on New Year’s Eve, according to the outlet. “To be surrounded by our family and friends tonight in such a beautiful location, and on New Year s Eve to boot, has just been magical,” Alex gushed to People at the time. “We are both so happy, grateful and excited to start our lives together as Mr. and Mrs. Carrasco,” she added. “I truly married my best friend.”</p><h2>Alex & Servando Are The Proud Parents Of A Daughter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>In 2020, Alex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a>&nbsp;to their first child,&nbsp;<strong>Charlie Elena Carrasco. </strong>“When I hit nine months, I thought to myself, ‘Am I ever gonna have my body back?’” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alex told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a>. ” “But, there are so many women that have been able to do it — <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my teammates</a>, and so many other women as well in professional sports,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The couple absolutely love to share their joy of parenthood on social media. Servando’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> is full of the most precious snaps of Alex and Charlie, including a terrific one in honor of Mother’s Day. “Happy Mother’s Day to the one that holds everything together,” Servando <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>. “Words can’t fully describe what you mean to our family. As Charlie says, we love you to the moon and back Mommy!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8ClnLFlnaS%2FqK3NZp%2Buq5KWu6V5lGpqbG9naHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-morgan-husband-5133773.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falex-morgan-husband-5133773.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falex-morgan-husband-5133773.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falex-morgan-husband-5133773.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-morgan-husband-5133773.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-morgan-husband-5133773.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carmen-herrera.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carmen-herrera.html>Carmen Herrera</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./josie-marans-husband-list.html>Who is Josie Maran Dating Josie Maran's Husband &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./josie-marans-husband-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
