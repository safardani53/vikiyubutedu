Rob, who was married to Hall of Fame quarterback <a href=#>Terry Bradshaw</a>'s daughter Rachel Bradshaw, died in a single car accident on Sept. 20, 2014. The story of his death includes two incidents of uncharacteristic road rage, and seems to have come almost totally at random.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Terry Bradshaw's daughter's husband die?</h2><p>Rob died at around 11 p.m. on Sept. 20 after driving his car off the road and into a drainage basin. The coroner reported that he had a blood alcohol level of .218, and also had traces of Valium in his system, although the effects of that drug would have been negligible. He was less than a mile from his home, and there didn't appear to be any skid marks on the road where he had crashed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Exactly 7 weeks from today (& 27mins) will be our moment of a lifetime!

One report suggested that he had tried to drive a truck full of college students off the road, which only further confused those who knew him best. &nbsp;</p><p>“Everybody is trying to make sense of why he acted the way he acted, because it’s unbelievable,” Patrick Martin, one of Rob's friends, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“And it’s not just one of those things where a buddy dies and you don’t want to believe that’s what he was," he continued. "We’re not trying to save face for him. That just was absolutely not him.”&nbsp;</p><p>The road rage Rob displayed on the night of his death was apparently out of character, and there doesn't seem to be a clear explanation for why he was drunk driving so late in the evening.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Terry Bradshaw's daughter said everything was normal the night her husband died.</h2><p><a href=#>Rachel Bradshaw</a> was watching a movie when Rob wished her good night that evening, and at the time, she believed he was simply going to bed. Later, when she couldn't find him, she eventually called 911. She also told police that he wasn't under the influence of any substances, although she said he'd had a beer that night. According to his missing person report, Rachel and Rob didn't even fight before he left.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Love this little lady that much & more!!! #MyBironas #Repost from @racheltbradshaw with @repostapp --- I really don't think I could love anything more.

They had dated for two years before tying the knot in 2014. His friends said that Rob rarely drank to excess, and was always careful to use a designated driver. He liked to drink during his football career, but had since cut back substantially, and every friend the magazine interviewed said that he rarely drank to excess.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when he did drink, Rob wasn't usually aggressive. In spite of all of the magazine's digging, they never came to a satisfactory conclusion for why Rob ended up drinking and driving aggressively in the minutes leading up to his death. The mystery will likely never be resolved in a clear-cut manner, and those who knew him just had to pick up the pieces and move on with their lives.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKzvthmmauZlKi1osOMnZiun5ipsrN5x66qm5memXqlscCtnw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fterry-bradshaw-daughter-husband-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fterry-bradshaw-daughter-husband-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fterry-bradshaw-daughter-husband-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fterry-bradshaw-daughter-husband-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fterry-bradshaw-daughter-husband-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fterry-bradshaw-daughter-husband-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./roy-hamilton-physician.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./roy-hamilton-physician.html>Fame | Roy Hamilton (physician) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhys-ifans.html>Rhys Ifans Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rhys-ifans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
