Yes, the name is getting a lot of press right now, but that’s just a silly coincidence that gets a laugh every time I tell someone my dogs name. • “When it’s your time to go, it’s your time to go.” my Aunt Karen would always say. Just a little backstory, Karen had a masters degree in education, taught and raised her 4 kids, and then went to work for the post office when she was 40. She had over 10 grandchildren, a brother, sister, and a loving husband (Pictured here-Uncle Jim). Lived a very full, beautiful life. • Sadly my Aunt Karen passed away a year and a half ago in the wildest way. ((You probably have a better chance getting struck by lightning 15 times in your life then to die like this.)) SHE WAS KILLED BY THE METAL CLIP ON A DOG LEASH. Yup. Her pup Rocket, pictured here, was hooked to the house on a long leash and chased after the neighbor dog and this little, seemingly harmless metal clip broke from the dogs collar, recoiled and hit my Aunt square in the center of her forehead. • She didn’t think anything of it, went and got stitches and pretty quickly things got worse. Unbeknownst to her and the doctors, her brain was swelling and filling with blood from the impact of the metal clip. She had immediate brain surgery but damage was beyond repair. She was kept alive until the plug was finally pulled 7 days later. She passed away with her family by her side. The doctors said the impact was similar to that of a bullet. Crazy. Just frickin’ crazy. • Life is precious y’all. I forget that sometimes. We all do. The truth: our opportunity to live can be taken away at any moment and I share this story not to scare us, but to encourage us to appreciate the journey. The ups and downs, twists and turns, pains and joys, victories and failures, and to remember to appreciate all the love we are lucky enough to give and receive in our days. • Sooooo I named my pup Karen to honor my late aunt Karen and I made sure to get a doggy that had some Labrador in her because that is the breed my aunt Karen always had. • I ❤️ You Aunt Karen!! #RESTINPEACE</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Travis Van Winkle</a> (@travisvanwinkle) on Jul 23, 2020 at 1:49pm PDT</p></figure><p>"Her pup Rocket, pictured here, was hooked to the house on a long leash and chased after the neighbor dog and this little, seemingly harmless metal clip broke from the dog's collar, recoiled, and hit my Aunt square in the center of her forehead."</p><p>He explained that the impact of the metal clip caused her brain to swell and sadly passed away.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Travis has shared some of his "dating rules" in the past.</h2><p>While he seems focused on his career at the moment, in 2012 Travis revealed what he looks for in a partner.&nbsp;</p><p>"I like when you date someone and there are not too many games going on," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alloy Entertainment</a>.
