This includes completely banning websites for UK users so that no one in Britain can access them – of any age</li><li>And the BBFC can also withdraw payment services so that UK users can't pay money to access the site</li><li>The controversial porn block will restrict access to adult websites, including free porn sites like PornHub and YouPorn – which attract nearly 2billion visits a month between them worldwide</li><li>They'll join a number of other sites in using the AgeID system, which requires users to verify their age via an official form of ID such as a driver's license or passport</li><li>Users will be shown a non-pornographic "landing page", according to AgeID spokesman James Clark</li><li>"When a user first visits a site protected by AgeID, a landing page will appear with a prompt for the user to verify their age before they can access the site. Each website will create their own non-pornographic landing page for this purpose," he told The Sun</li><li>When someone first clicks on a site, they'll be asked to register with AgeID and verify their age using a Mobile SMS, credit card, passport, or driving licence. Users will then be able to use their AgeID username or password to access all porn sites that use AgeID – though some may use different age verification systems</li><li>Clark said: "It is a one-time verification. Once a user has age verified once, on ANY site protected by AgeID, they will then simply pass-through or login to any other site using AgeID without needing to re-verify"</li><li>As well as registering with AgeID, Brits will also be able to access porn sites using a voucher you can buy from high street shops</li><li>Thousands of shops will offer the special ID cards, which users can link to an app known as Portes. Through Portes, they can then login to sites without having to hand over their email address</li><li>Clark said: "The PortesCard will be available to purchase from any of the UK’s 29,000 PayPoint outlets as a voucher</li><li>"It will also be available from selected high street retailers, which we can share more details on soon"</li><li>A unique validation code on the purchased card must be activated via the Portes app within 24 hours, otherwise it'll expire, he added. Verified users will then automatically be granted access to all sites using AgeID</li><li>Each PortesCard will cost £4.99 for use on a single device, or £8.99 for use across multiple devices</li></ul><p>Last month, The Sun exclusively revealed how the porn block risked creating a "sex tape black market" on social media, chat apps and even USB sticks.</p><p>Executive director Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, told The Sun: "If children want something, they'll generally be able to get it."</p><p>He warned that teens risk being pushed onto more extreme material as they skirt the ban – and said that the blocking system won't stop children accidentally seeing smut online either.</p><p>That's because the BBFC will be focusing on "mainstream" porn sites, but won't tackle smaller sites or social media apps like Twitter or Reddit.</p><p>And pornography will still be accessible through a simple Google Image search, which could put kids at risk.</p><p>"The government wanted to stop children who are under 12 from accidentally seeing porn," said Jim, who heads up ORG, a non-profit aimed at preserving digital rights, speaking to The Sun.</p><p>"But this just seems a very odd policy justification in the end, because the porn that children accidentally see is on Google search or Twitter, or pornographic adverts on slightly odd sites, like file-sharing sites.</p><p>"Those are probably where children most commonly accidentally see porn. But none of that is going to be blocked by this."</p><p>Ministers have implied that the job was so difficult it warranted additional time to get right – but internet rights experts think snuffing out porn is an impossible task.</p><p>"It can be shared on USB sticks, sent by email, shared on WhatsApp," Jim told us.</p><p>"And of course, children can guess their parents' credentials and log into these sites that way – or steal them.</p><p>"So it's pretty unlikely that this is really going to reduce teenagers' access to pornography."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TECH</h2></p><p>The UK porn block will completely ban <a href=#>some adult sites even if you're older than 18</a>.</p><p>And the porn block will only focus on "mainstream" websites – <a href=#>leaving smaller (and potentially more extreme) websites to thrive</a>.</p><p>The Sun recently revealed how the porn block could <a href=#>drive Brits underground to "dangerous sex websites"</a>.</p><p>Do you think the porn block is a good idea?
