The movie follows a recently divorced father, Scott Calvin (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tim Allen</a>), as he’s unexpectedly enlisted to become the new Santa. From rapidly gaining the mythical character's trademark jolly belly to growing a snow-white beard and more, Calvin's journey to embracing his new destiny is both comical and heartwarming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The film, while centered around Santa, is also beloved for its memorable cast and characters — from elves like Bernard (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>David Krumholtz</a>) and Judy (Paige Tamada) to Scott's son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Santa Clause had two sequels: The Santa Clause 2 (2002) and The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause (2006).

His first major acting role before The Santa Clause was starring as Tim Taylor in the hit sitcom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Home Improvement</a> from 1991 to 1999.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apart from the holiday comedy and its follow-ups, Allen went on to voice Buzz Lightyear in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Toy Story franchise</a>. He also starred in movies like Galaxy Quest (1999) and Wild Hogs (2007) before landing another starring sitcom role in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Last Man Standing</a>, which aired from 2011 to 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Allen reprised his role as Scott for The Santa Clauses. Speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, he shared what it was like to don his iconic Santa suit again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I show up dressed in the full suit and everything else, there's big smiles on people's faces. ...

It does feel like Santa's in the room,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The latest Santa Clause project is also special to Allen because he’s working alongside his daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elizabeth Allen-Dick</a>, who plays his daughter in the show as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Allen spoke to PEOPLE in October 2022 and revealed the advice he gave her before filming began. “The writers, producers and crew have the most important roles on a production," the actor said.

He welcomed his first child with then-wife Laura Deibel, who formally separated from him in 1999.
