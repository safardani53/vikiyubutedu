This Bobbi chick’s lame."</p><p>A fourth tweeted: "People really upset Bobbi didn't catch 'the vibe' at Drake's concert [laughing emoji]."</p><p>Another group of sleuths have theorized <a href=#>Drake attempted to pursue a romantic relationship</a> with Bobbi but the former's feelings weren't returned by the latter.</p><p>Taking to Twitter, one observer speculated: "Drake Reportedly Tried To Sleep With Bobbi Athloff After She Attended His Concert But She Rejected Him.</p><p>"The Interview Was Then Pulled & He Blocked Her On All Socials."</p><p>Another fan said: "Bobbi did nothing wrong. Drake can’t be trusted."</p><p>Meanwhile, an additional sleuth concluded: "Everyone thinks it’s Drake when in reality I think it was Bobbi’s husband who probably got salty and made her block him & repost him on her Instagram."</p><p>"He had to have made a move on her or something," commented a fourth user.</p><h2>What did Bobbi say about the rumors?</h2><p>On August 16, 2023, Bobbi took to her Instagram story to lay the rumors to rest by sharing "an uncensored DM" exchange she’d had with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy.</p><p>“My girlfriend says you hooked up with Drake and got divorced. I am saying that is not true,” Dave's message read.</p><p>Bobbi replied, “I am not commenting publicly but off the record, you’re right that is not true.”</p><p>Atop the screenshot, she added: “I did not want to do this podcast in the first place, and now so much negativity is coming from it.”</p><p>The 26-year-old vowed to “leave it alone after this” without elaborating on what she and the rapper are beefing about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/www-instagram-com-p-cuwmwdalyby-832581338.jpg><h2>How did Bobbi land her interview with Drake?</h2><p>Prior to her wiping it from her YouTube channel, Bobbi's interview with Drake was one of her highest-viewed videos.</p><p>Regarding how the two came together, Bobbi revealed the hitmaker liked her episode with Funny Marco and followed her.</p><p>After the rapper followed her, Bobbi took a chance and sent him a direct message.</p><p>"I decided to just go for it and shoot my shot," the podcaster told <a href=# aria-label="Cosmopolitan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>.</p><p>"I DMed Drake and asked if he wanted to be on my podcast, and he said yes.</p><p>"He sent me his touring schedule, and I knew that I needed to make it happen fast, so my friend and I flew to Memphis two days after the original DM was sent to record the episode."</p><h2>Is Bobbi Althoff still married?</h2><p>Bobbi is married to tech executive, Cory Althoff.</p><p>The pair reportedly got engaged back in October 2019.</p><p>In an August 2023, interview with <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>, Bobbi told the outlet: "I prefer to keep my relationship private."</p><p>"I’m very insecure, and the character that I’ve created is made up of my biggest insecurities.
