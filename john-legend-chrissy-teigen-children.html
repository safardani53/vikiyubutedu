"And then we get to where we're going, they're like, 'Oh my gosh, he must be thirsty.' This might sound crazy to people, but they'll put a little glass of water next to his little box of ashes.

"They say you get a thick skin, and it is true. You get a thick skin, and you're able to deal with the emotions better that come with being hurt or let down again," she said. "But, of course, it still hurts. And, of course, you still go through it and you learn how important it is to be able to take care of yourself and go to therapy and to talk to people about any worries or anxieties you might be having."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Teigen previously labeled the experience a pregnancy loss, in September 2022 she clarified that she had had a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>life-saving abortion</a>. "Let's just call it what it was: It was an abortion," she explained at a social impact summit. "An abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance.
