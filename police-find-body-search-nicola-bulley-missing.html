I feel like I’m in the Truman show.</p><p>"Like, I honestly believe I’m going to wake up at any moment…how are we even in this? We are good people.”</p><p>Paul also said he feels "anger, loads of frustration, confusion, disbelief, surrealism" as the family goes through "unprecedented hell".</p><p>Officers previously released a timeline of the missing mum's&nbsp;<a href=#>final movements</a>&nbsp;before she disappeared.</p><p>Nicola began her walk along the towpath to the River Wyre at 8.43am after dropping her two children off at school.</p><p>Police say around seven minutes later, a dog walker who knows Nicola saw her walking around the lower field with her springer spaniel Willow.</p><p>The witness said their two dogs interacted briefly before she left Nicola via the river path.</p><p>At 8.53am, the mum sent an email to her boss at Exclusively Mortgages.</p><p>She then logged into a Teams call at 9.01am and was seen around nine minutes later on the upper field walking Willow.</p><p>Police say at 9.30am, the work call ended but Nicola stayed logged on.</p><p>At around 9.35am, the mobile and Willow were found at a bench by the river but there was no sign of Nicola.</p><p>An&nbsp;<a href=#>extensive search</a>&nbsp;was launched to find the mum-of-two, involving police, firefighters, mountain rescue, underwater teams and the local community.</p><p>Officers scoured wooded areas, ditches, water margins and the grounds of an abandoned house.</p><p>A specialist search was also launched by dive expert <a href=#>Peter Faulding</a>, who used £50,000 sonar equipment to scour the water.</p><p>He later <a href=#>pulled out of the hunt</a>, saying he did not believe Nicola was in the river as she could have "stood up" if she fell in.</p><p>Nicola's partner Paul and sister Louise Cunningham also expressed their doubts at the police hypothesis.</p><p>Speaking after the tragic find today, Peter tweeted: "Our thoughts are with Nicola's family and friends at this difficult time. #nicolabulley"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
