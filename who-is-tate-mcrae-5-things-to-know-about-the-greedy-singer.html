She was 14 when she wrote it.</p><p>After the success of “One Day,” McRae continued to build a sizable following on YouTube and TikTok. She signed with RCA Records in August 2019 and has since released two EP’s (2020’s All the Things I Never Said and 2021’s Too Young to Be Sad) and two studio albums (2022’s I Used to Think I Could Fly and 2023’s Think Later).</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything you need to know about McRae:</p><h3>1. She Was on ‘So You Think You Can Dance’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tate-McRae-5-Things-to-Know-009.jpg><p>Before making her mark as a singer, McRae was known for a successful stint on the reality competition show So You Think You Can Dance, which featured dancers between the ages of 8 and 13 on its 13th season. At 12 years old, she became the first Canadian finalist in the show’s history.</p><p>“I started dancing around the age of 6,” McRae told <a href=# rel=noopener>Everly Mag</a> in March 2018. “It began as a hobby that I was definitely not seriously interested in. I loved performing, but hated when I actually had to do what I was told. I only started getting serious when my mom took me to New York at age 8.”</p><h3>2. She Has a Song Written by Billie Eilish</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tate-McRae-5-Things-to-Know-024.jpg><p>The lead single for McRae’s debut EP, titled “Tear Myself Apart,” was written by brother-sister songwriting duo Eilish and <strong>Finneas O’Connell</strong>.</p><p>“I’m a huge fan of both of them,” McRae said of Eilish and O’Connell during a December 2020 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. “I got to meet Billie and Finneas at a show in L.A. and we talked about it. It was a really cool experience overall.”</p><p>Despite her admiration for Eilish, McRae said during a May 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Music</a> magazine that she finds it “a little lazy” when people compare them to each other.</p><p>“There’s so many new female artists right now that are coming into the industry, so, like, obviously there’s gonna be similarities,” McRae said. “I mean, [Billie’s] so inspiring and she’s so incredible, but I do think our music is wildly different.”</p><h3>3. She’s In an Olivia Rodrigo Music Video</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tate-McRae-5-Things-to-Know-014.jpg><p>McRae is featured in the <a href=#>music video</a> for Rodrigo’s 2023 single “Bad Idea Right?” She can be seen getting ready in a bathroom mirror and lip-synching to Rodrigo’s backing vocals along with <strong>Iris Apatow</strong> and Rodrigo’s former Bizaardvark costar Madison <strong>Hu</strong>.</p><p>“[Olivia] just texted me and she’s like, ‘Oh, do you want to do a music video, like, tomorrow?’ And I was like, ‘Sure!’” McRae recalled during a September 2023 SiriusXM interview. She also sang Rodrigo’s praises during a December 2023 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Elite Daily</a>.</p><p>“I adore Olivia,” she said. “She’s one of my closest friends in L.A., and I think she is one of the most talented people I’ve ever met. We have a lot of fun.”</p><h3>4. She Dated Hockey Player Cole Sillinger</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tate-McRae-5-Things-to-Know-011.jpg><p>McRae and the NHL athlete went Instagram official in August 2022 when McRae posted <a href=# rel=noopener>photos</a> of them on vacation together. Before the pair started dating, Sillinger admitted in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> that McRae was his celebrity crush.</p><p>“I was like, ‘I can forever hold this to you until the day you die, that I was your <a href=#>celebrity crush</a>,” McRae joked to <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> in August 2022. “He’s one of my brother’s friend’s friend’s, so, it all, like, worked out.”</p><p>While the duo never addressed their split, McRae said that she is “single at the moment” during a September 2023 appearance on SiriusXM.</p><p>Some fans think that the September 2023 music video for McRae’s song “Greedy” is inspired by her ex, as it takes place at an ice rink. McRae wears a hockey uniform and drives a Zamboni in the video.</p><p>“So sure of yourself, baby don’t get greedy / that s—t won’t end well,” she sings on the track.</p><p>The “Exes” musician also donned hockey pads on the album cover of Think Later, for which “Greedy” is a single.</p><h3>5. Her Sophomore Album Is About Living in the Moment</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tate-McRae-5-Things-to-Know-013.jpg><p>The title for McRae’s second album, Think Later — which was released in December 2023 — came from a quote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[The quote is]: ‘Live now, think later; dance now, think later; sing now, think later,’” McRae said during a December 2023 interview with Elite Daily. “The idea of being super present in life and living with your intuition in your heart rather than your head.”</p><p>She continued: “I’ve been a pretty big overthinker and perfectionist my whole life. In the last year and a half, I’ve made a lot of decisions and gone through a lot of experiences without thinking as much, which resulted in me falling harder in love and feeling things way more intensely, but then also making completely different decisions than I ever would.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJ9itrR505qrnmWdmL%2BisYxuZK2gmaO0tHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnqovsSem7Jlo567qLHRaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-tate-mcrae-5-things-to-know-about-the-greedy-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-tate-mcrae-5-things-to-know-about-the-greedy-singer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-tate-mcrae-5-things-to-know-about-the-greedy-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-tate-mcrae-5-things-to-know-about-the-greedy-singer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-tate-mcrae-5-things-to-know-about-the-greedy-singer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tate-mcrae-5-things-to-know-about-the-greedy-singer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bud-abbott-18951002-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bud-abbott-18951002-html.html>Bud Abbott (Comedian) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-emily-roeske-dating.html>Who is Emily Roeske Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-emily-roeske-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
