Ken asked.</p><p>"$7200 wow!" the host declared in a daze when Troy revealed a bet that was larger than expected - or needed.</p><p>"An even $40,000!" the host who knows a thing or 74 about winning concluded.</p><p>Troy was declared the victor with a huge total looking so grateful.</p><p>He's now the fifth contestant to qualify for next year's <a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>, though viewers don't think he's going home to prep anytime soon.</p><p>The others are&nbsp;<a href=#>fan-favorite Ray Lalonde</a>&nbsp;with 13 wins,&nbsp;<a href=#>former poker ace Cris Pannullo with 21 wins</a>,&nbsp;five-day champ&nbsp;<a href=#>Luigi de Guzman</a>,&nbsp;and four-day champ and priest&nbsp;<a href=#>David Sibley</a>.</p><h2>'ABSOLUTE MACHINE'</h2><p>Fans in a Reddit thread were pumped up as the ongoing champ would seem to be picking up steam as he goes.</p><p>One viewer wrote: "Troy has been an absolute machine since that first day and it’s been amazing to watch."</p><p>Another claimed: "In terms of four-day totals, Troy is ahead of everyone on the 10+ games list except for <a href=#>Amy [Schneider]</a> and <a href=#>James [Holzhauer]</a>, which bodes very well for him."</p><p>"Troy is now going bigger in the Final Jeopardy bet..." wrote a third.</p><p>A fourth agreed: "Anything over $130,000 through 4 games is getting into some pretty lofty company."</p><p>A fifth even expressed: "I honestly hope he surpasses Cris Pannullo. So far, Troy is doing a superb job! Keep up the good work, Troy!"</p><h2>WHO IS: TROY MEYER</h2><p>Troy began competing last Thursday - his emotional first win saw him looking up above near tears for the sweetest reason.</p><p>Troy's mother recently passed away and they "shared a big love" of watching Jeopardy! together, host Ken shared.</p><p>As Troy also briefly touched on tonight and last night, his&nbsp;<a href=#>wife Genevieve was a contestant in 2009</a>&nbsp;and they anonymously met online in the winningest way - on a Jeopardy! practice website when she was prepping.</p><p>Troy told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>&nbsp;in their 2010 wedding announcement: "I talked to friends, and they thought I was absolutely nuts."</p><p>They kept in touch, but Troy didn't know what she looked like until her episode aired.</p><p>Troy told the New York Times that before then: "I thought she was 55 years old."</p><p>They finally met up in person after she competed: “Within the first 24 hours we just wanted to be together,” Genevieve told the&nbsp;New York Times. They now share a son, 10.</p><p>Troy - whom some fans have admitted looks like&nbsp;<a href=#>Bill Hader</a>&nbsp;- is one of the top U.S. trivia players - or quizzers.</p><p>He is a four-time winner of the niche, online invite-only Learned League, a trivia club that has 25,000-plus members, and Jeopardy!-like questions.</p><p>It's no easy feat to "win the scarf," the prize given to the secret league's champ, once, let alone four times.</p><p>Many Jeopardy! champs are, or secretly were, members including host&nbsp;Ken, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Yorker</a>&nbsp;- he had to step down for obvious reasons.</p><p>As a result, many fans were buzzing about him online before his arrival and he's surely starting to live up to the hype.</p><p>Meanwhile, Troy also doesn't have any social media accounts - which is another sign he could be our next serious winner as champs are advised by the show to keep a low profile, or profiles.</p><h2>'BLOSSOM' INTO SPRING WITH MAYIM</h2><p>Co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 47, is expected to return<a href=#>&nbsp;to the game show in late February</a>.</p><p>With her Call Me Kat schedule running longer than expected, Mayim will be commencing her hosting duties with a&nbsp;new&nbsp;<a href=#>teen tournament.</a></p><p>Fans will be getting more of Ken as he will be hosting the new&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!
