<time>16 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>FORMER child star Elle Fanning has told how sex scenes in her sizzling new TV sensation are “outrageous”.</strong></p><p>The American actress is most well known for her innocent teen roles in Maleficent next to Angelina Jolie and JJ Abrams’ 2011 hit Super 8.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000529766979.jpg><p>But Elle, 22, relished playing a more grown-up part as Catherine the Great — the 18th century empress renowned for her sexual appetite and the modernisation of Russia.</p><p>She said: “Catherine The Great’s sexuality blossomed. And she loved being experimental, so of course that would be a big part of her character.”</p><p>Elle, who is the executive producer and star of Channel 4’s The Great, alongside X-Men actor Nicholas Hoult, 30, as her philandering husband Peter III, said: “Sex is a really big part of the show.</p><p>“Mostly those scenes I have are with Nick and I’m so comfortable with him.</p><p>“Also, a lot of it was so outrageous that we would just laugh through it. Most of the time you’re like, ‘This is crazy’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000583746713-2.jpg><p>During the ten-part series — on Channel 4 early next year and on streaming service Starzplay from June 18 — Elle flashes the flesh as her promiscuous character bed-hops between her husband and lover Leo Voronsky, played by Sebastian de Souza.</p><p>An “intimacy co-ordinator” was employed on set given the high level of steamy content and to ensure the well-being of the cast.</p><p>Elle was relieved Nick, whose breakthrough role was in 2002’s About A Boy, was cast as her husband as they have similar approaches to acting, which made the sex scenes easier to film.</p><p>The actress — whose sister <a href=#>Dakota, 26</a>, starred in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and Ocean’s 8 — said: “It was funny but I felt totally fine doing it. It was a part of the character, completely a part of who she was.</p><p>On set, Nick and I are on the same page</p><p>“I start young in this and you get to see me age throughout this series and grow up.</p><p>“I’m glad I had Nick as that partner to be there with me because we work in a very similar way, maybe because we both were child actors.</p><p>“There’s some­thing about when we’re on set that we just are kind of on the same page. It’s like, ‘All right. Let’s get this done’.</p><p>“We have the same mentality. So it was good to have him there. It’s an understanding, I think.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000585504640.jpg><p>Elle admits being a child actor and facing rejection led to a sense of powerlessness, but she has now realised that “my voice matters”.</p><p>In fact, Elle is so revered that last year she became the youngest ever jury member at the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>She said: “I’ve learned that being in an industry like this, you don’t have a lot of power sometimes because you’re offered roles and people either say no or yes to you.</p><p>“Growing up, there was a lot of rejection that comes with that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000585506318-e1590860204912.jpg><p>“And sometimes you are powerless in those situations. But you have to learn how to get your power back. For me, now that I’m older, it’s kind of diving into a bit more behind the scenes, being able to produce my own projects or reading books and articles that I think would be interesting to become a movie or a TV show and learning that my voice matters.</p><p>“And it’s like ‘Yeah I can have the power to carve out my future and be able to make things happen more’.</p><p>“So it’s a beautiful thing as you grow up, and in this industry too, finding what you love to do and where you fit.</p><p>“And I’m only 22, but I’m at least starting to have that a little bit more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000586076641.jpg><p>“None of us want to feel powerless in our lives. We want to take charge. But yes, I’ve learned to do that — or am trying.”</p><p>Catherine The Great showed her might when she unseated her husband with a bloodless coup in 1762, yet she was not immune to making mistakes.</p><p>And Elle believes this is the type of strong female character audiences want to see on screen, like Killing Eve’s Villanelle or Fleabag.</p><p>Elle said: “Catherine is, of course, a strong character but she doesn’t always make the right choices.</p><p>“I think that’s what’s interesting about watching.</p><p>“We’ve had a lot of great female characters on TV lately that don’t always do exactly the right thing. And I am happy that we’re allowed to show women in that way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000583531919.jpg><p>“She does make a lot of very, very hard choices throughout the series that I don’t know if I’d be able to make.”</p><p>Away from movie sets Elle has always been surrounded by strong women, including her mum Heather, 53, and maternal grandmother Mary Jane Odum, 73.</p><p>Elle said: “My grandmother used to go with me on all my film sets when I was young. And my mum would go with my sister.</p><p>“My grandmother has always lived with us.</p><p>“It’s great to have those generations of women in your family.</p><p>“We’re very Southern women. We’re from Georgia.</p><p>“My grandmother was a rodeo queen and very opinionated.</p><p>“So that’s always been in our house — a lot of opinionated women wanting us to speak your mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000585504645.jpg><p>Elle has been spending lockdown with her mother — who is divorced from her dad Steven, 53, a former baseball player who now sells electronics — her grandmother, Dakota and boyfriend Max Minghella, 34, who was the star of Facebook film The Social Network and The Handmaid’s Tale.</p><p>To keep busy during quarantine — and entertain her 4.5million Instagram followers — Elle has taken inspiration from comedian Chelsea Peretti’s make-up tutorials and posted her own colourful attempts.</p><p>She has also attempted viral TikTok dances — calling the results “embarrassing” — baked, painted and joined the celeb trend of dyeing her naturally blonde hair orange.</p><p>Elle said: “I’m getting to spend a lot more time with my family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000586076431.jpg><p>“My sister is painting a lot. It’s interesting to see all this painting around my house, which we normally don’t do. We’re getting creative.</p><p>“Me and my sister, we’re together at this time and just having great family time and meals together.</p><p>“We’re baking a lot more and cooking.</p><p>“I don’t have my own house so when I’m not filming I get to come back and sleep in my childhood bed.</p><p>“My sister has just bought a house in New York but it’s not ready yet. So we’re all together.”</p><p>Elle will be spending even more time with Dakota as they are to play fictional French sisters Isabelle and Vianne in World War Two drama, The Nightingale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000585505605.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>The pandemic has delayed production but the film, based on Kristin Hannah’s novel, is expected to be released in December 2021.</p><p>Elle added: “We’re hoping that it will still happen, I mean, that’s the plan. But none of us can predict the future of when things are going to start again.</p><p>“Of course, that’s something that we hope will pick back up when everything starts moving again. We just want to be healthy and safe and OK.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">CATHERINE II</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000586080158-e1590859959676-2.jpg><p><strong>CATHERINE II (1729-1796) was Empress of Russia&nbsp; from 1762 to 1796.
