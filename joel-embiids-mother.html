She has three children from her husband, Thomas Embiid.</p><p>Joel Embiid is the eldest, while her two other children are daughter Muriel Embiid and son Arthur Embiid.</p><p>Unfortunately, Christine lost her younger son <a href=# rel=noopener>Arthur Embiid</a> in a car crash on 16 October 2014. Arthur was only 13 at that time.</p><p>For a mother, nothing is more painful than her children going far away and never returning. It was a massive loss for the family; they are still not over that incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/old-pic.jpg><p>Christine has a pretty decent economic background. They were not very rich but had everything they needed. Christine’s husband, <a href=# rel=noopener>Thomas Embiid</a>, was a military officer in Cameroon.</p><p>Thomas also used to play handball as a recreational sport. Thus, his son, Joel, was little interested in sports since his early days.</p><p>Initially, Joel’s mother wanted him to become a doctor. Although his son always dreamt of becoming an NBA player.&nbsp;</p><p>So, she couldn’t help but support her son’s dream and approved him to pursue his passion.</p><p>She was kind but strict when it came to her children’s education. Christine was in charge of their homework and made sure to complete their school tasks.</p><h2>Younger Son Arthur Embiid Death</h2><p>Christine’s younger son Arthur Embiid died in a car crash on 16 October 2014. Arthur&nbsp;was a kid who always gave off positive energy and was fun to be around.</p><p>When Joel got invited to Luc Mbah, a Moute’s basketball camp, he didn’t appear in the center. Instead, he stayed at home and played with Arthur all day.</p><p>Christine Embiid’s mother was on vacation, so two brothers took that opportunity to chill and play video games all day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/brother-arthur.jpg><p>Going to the NBA or college in the States wasn’t even a dream for Joel. All he wanted was to be with Arthur at home and play.</p><p>During an interview, Joel Embiid shared a heartfelt moment that stands out among all of his incredible basketball achievements.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite having achieved numerous accolades and accomplishments in his basketball career, Embiid’s compassion and kindness towards Arthur resonated with him in a way that surpassed any on-court victory.&nbsp;</p><h3>Joel Embiid’s Struggle After His Brother’s Death</h3><p>Joel hadn’t seen Arthur for three years when he was about to get drafted in 2014. But Arthur was following Joel’s journey from far away and was so proud of his big brother.</p><p>Before the draft, Joel got foot surgery. Arthur flew out to the East Coast to see Joel, but due to some reason, they couldn’t see each other. Arthur was only thirteen and had all the time to return to see Joel.</p><p>They discussed how Arthur would return to America to see Joel play league on the phone. But at that, nobody had imagined Joel would never see Arthur again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/embiidtweetpicCROP_t560.jpg><p>After four months, Joel got a phone call from a family that Arthur got involved in a car accident while returning from school.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like that youngest member of the family was gone. The whole family went through colossal shock and has been dealing with this horrific incident till now.</p><h2>Childhood Story</h2><p>Joel has a funny personality and an excellent social media presence. Born and raised in Cameroon, young Joel was not a basketball lover. Instead, he was a volleyball enthusiast.</p><p>In 2009, he switched to basketball from volleyball. However, it was not difficult for him to switch to basketball as Joel had trained his hands to direct the ball, and he had an excellent height.</p><p>He soon started playing seriously after the NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon believed the sport would significantly impact Joel’s life and had a career waiting for him ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joel-with-young-fans.jpg><p>Joel was discovered at a basketball court by Cameroonian NBA player Mbah a Moute, who mentored him. Thus, to start his career as a professional player, he moved to the USA at 16.</p><p>While in the States, he played basketball at Montverde Academy and Rock School. The four-time NBA All-Star attended the University of Kansas in 2013 before being drafted in 2014.</p><p>The Philadelphia 76ers picked him as the third overall player in the 2014 NBA Draft. But some unfortunate events happened right before his draft.</p><p>In the accident, he lost his only brother and got foot and knee injuries.</p><p>Joel’s loyalty to his late brother becoming a well-known basketball player and making the late brother proud encouraged him during those tough times.</p><h3>Joel’s Rise To Fame Story</h3><p>Since Joel took a step ahead to become a successful basketball player, his parents, especially Joel’s mother, dreamt of seeing him in the NBA.</p><p>Joel officially debuted in the 76ers’ season opener against Oklahoma City Thunder on 26 October 2016. Joel recorded 20 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in a 103-97 loss in his first professional game.</p><p>On 11 January 2017, Joel grabbed a then-career-high 14 rebounds in a 98-97 win over the New York Knicks.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/560f3155bfc1b5243ad5555d768de623.jpg><p>Later, he was named to World Team for the 2017 Rising Star Challenge and Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month</p><p>Joel became the established player in the 76ers and became the next face of the NBA after <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron James</a>. He is an unquestioned leader of the Sixers.</p><h3>Joel Embiid And His Love For The Philadelphia 76ers</h3><p>Joel is a great basketball player but also a remarkable human being. His team, Sixers, response towards him is always supportive. Not only by the team, but the applause and praise he gets from fans are also excellent.</p><p>For a long time, Embiid has meant a lot to the 76ers. But, even Joel’s goal is to remain for one team Sixers, his entire career, like the late <a href=# rel=noopener>Kobe Bryant</a>, who stayed for his team Lakers, throughout his career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/asdcv.webp><p>He has this unconditional love for the Sixers that is hard to explain. He wants to give his best in every game in return for that love and fame.</p><p>As of late, Nuggets<a href=# rel=noopener> Nikola Jokic</a>, Bucks Giannis, and Joel are in a race to win the MVP as the NBA regular season comes down the final stretch.</p><p>On the ongoing MVP race, the 76ers coach Doc Rivers said, “the man just scored half of our points in an NBA game…the MVP race is over“, after Embiid’s 52 points game against the Celtics on April 5, 2023.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Joel Embiid’s mother’s profession is unknown, but her son Joel is a millionaire. Joel earns quite a good amount of money which helps them to live a luxurious lifestyle.</p><p>In 2017, he signed a five-year/$147,710,050 contract with the 76er, including $147,710,050 guaranteed and an annual average salary of $29,542,010.</p><p>Embiid earns a base salary of $33,616,770 while carrying a cap hit of $33,616,770 and a dead cap value of $33,616,770. He has an estimated net worth of <strong>$35 million</strong> as of 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joel-embiid-76ers-slow-start.jpg><p>Joel Embiid’s philanthropic efforts extend far beyond his own personal gain and material wealth.</p><p>In addition to his on-court successes, he has demonstrated a deep commitment to giving back to his community and making a positive impact on the world.</p><p>By allocating a portion of his net worth to his parents’ foundation in Cameroon, Embiid is actively working towards eradicating poverty and supporting vulnerable populations in his homeland.</p><p>This kind of selflessness and generosity is admirable, particularly given the economic challenges facing many African nations, including Cameroon.</p><h2>Popularity Graph&nbsp;</h2><p>Christine is renowned as the celebrity mother of Joel Embiid.
