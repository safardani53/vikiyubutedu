In 2005, he received a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, as well as three Golden Globe nominations for his role on the program.</p><p>Zach Braff started dating Florence Pugh in 2019. Florence Pugh is recognized for her breakthrough appearances in Ari Aster’s folk-horror Midsommar (2019), Greta Gerwig’s period drama Little Women (2019), and Marvel Studios’ Black Widow (2019). (2021).</p><p>The social media connection between Florence Pugh and Zach Braff started in 2018 when Braff commended Pugh on Twitter for her performance in the historical play Lady Macbeth. They started dating in 2019 after the release of Braff’s short film, In The Time It Takes to Get There, for Adobe Cloud, in which Pugh co-starred as a 19th-century influencer with Alicia Silverstone.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Zach-Braff-2.jpg alt="Zach Braff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Pugh recently told Harper’s Bazaar that she and Braff, who is 21 years older, broke up secretly early this year after dating for almost two years. She stated:</p><p>“We’ve been trying to do this separation without the rest of the world knowing since it’s a relationship on which everyone has an opinion.” We simply believed that doing something like this would help us avoid having millions of people tell us how pleased they are that we aren’t together. So that’s what we did. When I speak about it, I get a knot in my throat.”</p><p>In the aftermath of the couple’s divorce, let’s look at some of Zach Braff’s lesser-known facts.</p><h2>3 Facts About Zach Braff You Might Not Know</h2><h2>1) He loves dogs.</h2><p>Zach Braff is a major dog lover. Roscoe Braff, his adoptive dog, died in 2020. He and his then-partner Florence Pugh adopted a dog called Billie from the Labelle Foundation, a Los Angeles-based animal rescue organization, during the COVID-19 outbreak in April 2020. They ultimately chose to formally adopt Billie. In an April 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Braff mentioned adopting Billie. He stated:</p><p>“We believed we were going to foster this puppy, but we did something that I had no idea was termed ‘foster fail.'” And, of course, we were like, ‘We’re never giving this dog back,’ after like 30 seconds of holding it. I joke that we should have called her serotonin since she makes me so happy.”</p><h2>2) He is a licensed pilot.</h2><p>‘Zach Braff has a pilot’s license. He took flying lessons since he was a fearful flyer. He supposedly grew hooked to aviation after taking flying lessons. Braff noted in an interview with Ellen:</p><p>“It’s ideal for a neurotic Jew.” I started into it because I’d developed a fear of flying and believed learning how it worked would help me relax – now I’m addicted. It calms your mind; when you think a lot and your brain is racing all the time, it needs to halt so you can concentrate.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Zach-Braff-1.jpg alt="Zach Braff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>3) He is close to his Scrubs co-star Donald Faison.</h2><p>Like their on-screen characters Turk and J.D., Zach Braff and his Scrubs co-star Donald Faison are great friends. They even booked a room in New York City and lived together as roommates after the first season of Scrubs. They apparently spent the summer playing ping pong in their undies.</p><p>Faison met his wife Cacee Cobb during Braff’s 30th birthday party in 2005, and they married in 2012 in Braff’s garden in a stunning rustic-themed ceremony, with Braff acting as a groomsman. Braff is also the godfather of their two sons, Rocco and Wilder. During the Covid-19 epidemic, Braff and Faison electronically partnered to produce a podcast series called Fake Doctors, Real Friends, in which they recounted their Scrubs memories and situations. They met once again to play neighbors in a T-Mobile Super Bowl ad in 2022.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhqZp6RmMG0edOhmK1lqaTCbrrEnptmrJ9iuK%2B71maYm6elqXq7rcKhZJuqkZuzcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f3-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-zach-braff.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f3-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-zach-braff.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f3-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-zach-braff.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f3-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-zach-braff.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f3-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-zach-braff.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f3-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-zach-braff.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-1st-birthday-gift-ideas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-1st-birthday-gift-ideas.html>Best First Birthday Gift and Party Ideas 2022 | The Sun UK</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wissam-ben-yedder.html>Wissam Ben Yedder- Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wissam-ben-yedder.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
