As one of the pioneers of mainstream rock music, Elvis helped push boundaries and elevate the genre to the level of success it enjoys to this day.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, for however legendary Elvis's career in music was, his time in the spotlight was quite short.

It has been debated for years.</h2><p>Elvis's final months on Earth were a far departure from the glitz and glamour surrounding his career as a famous musician. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, the singer gained quite a bit of weight and became increasingly unable to perform at his full potential. A lot of Elvis's mental and physical state toward the end of his life had to do with his addictions to barbiturates and pethidine. The barbiturates made him overdose twice and enter a three-day-long coma once, while the pethidine left him hospitalized and semi-comatose.</p><p>Elvis made it through those harrowing moments, but the combined effects of his addictions as well as the dissolving of his marriage to <a href=#>Priscilla Presley</a> took a toll on him in general. His final shows were arguably the worst of his career and saw numerous publications criticize his singing ability as well as his appearance on stage.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On Aug. 16, 1977, just before Elvis was supposed to fly from his Memphis home to begin another tour, his girlfriend Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the floor of his bathroom. Elvis was rushed to Baptist Memorial Hospital, but attempts to revive him failed. He died on that day at 44 years old. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, Memphis medical examiner Jerry Francisco initially attributed Elvis's death to cardiac arrest and ruled out the possibility of drugs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, a subsequent conflicting report shared by Wikipedia claimed that Elvis's death was due to "anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy."</p><p>Two months later, lab reports suggested polypharmacy was the cause of Elvis's death, claiming that "fourteen drugs" were found "in Elvis's system, ten in significant quantity."</p><p>Then, in 1979, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that a combination of central nervous system depressants resulted in Elvis's death. This theory was then added onto by Michael Baden, who said in his 1990 book Unnatural Death: Confessions of a Medical Examiner that Elvis had an enlarged heart that, coupled with his drug issues, caused his death.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By 1994, former Miami-Dade coroner Joseph Davis stated, "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>But the conflicting theories surrounding Elvis's death didn't stop there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Perhaps one of the most outlandish claims about Elvis's passing came from writer Frank Coffey, who theorized in his 1997 book The Complete Idiot's Guide to Elvis that the singer's death was due to the Valsalva maneuver. This "maneuver" is essentially described as overstraining oneself while using the toilet, causing a heart attack. He cited Elvis's drug use as a cause for constipation that may have ended up in his having a heart attack.</p><p>In 2013, physician Forest S. Tennant Jr. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that Elvis's "drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that damaged his brain," as well as a toxic reaction to codeine.</p><p>When DNA analysis was done on a hair sample in 2014 that was claimed to have belonged to Elvis, also per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, it revealed that he had genetic variants that could have led to glaucoma, migraines, obesity, and the heart muscle disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This was the most conclusive evidence to date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrm3tdJmp6udo6GyunnCmqysnV2ks26wxJqroQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felvis-presley-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2felvis-presley-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2felvis-presley-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2felvis-presley-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felvis-presley-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2felvis-presley-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-beyonces-uncle-jonny-4802466.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-beyonces-uncle-jonny-4802466.html>Who Is Beyonces Uncle Jonny? 5 Things About The Singers Gay Uncle Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dhsfrzvoiunxtctz788ykppkut5yphym.html>Watch SpongeBob DocuPants Season 1 Episode 3: The Hash-Slinging Slasher</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dhsfrzvoiunxtctz788ykppkut5yphym.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
