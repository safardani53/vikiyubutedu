She later retired to oversee the media relations of Toews.</p><p>Toews is a bilingual who speaks French and English fluently. He and his brother, David Toews, are both ice hockey players, and both play for the NFL.</p><p>Their cousin Kai Toews is a basketball player. It is safe to assume that the Toews are an athletic bunch.</p><p>Jonathan Toews played in the Shattuck-Saint Mary’s in Fairbault, Minnesota, and later in the University of South Dakota.</p><p>He played two seasons at University before he was drafted in the first draft of the NHL in the third pick of 2007.</p><p>Read about <a href=#>Brad Skjei</a> too!!</p><h2>Jonathan Toews – Professional Life, Chicago Blackhawks</h2><p>Toews was selected in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in the third pick by the Chicago Blackhawks. He signed a three-year entry-level contract in 2007, and for that, he left the remaining two years in college.</p><h3>Chicago Blackhawks</h3><p>Jonathan Toews scored his first goal in his first game against the San Jose Sharks. He also brilliantly scored the second-longest point-scoring streak to start an NHL career as he recorded each of his first ten games with 5 goals and five assists.</p><p>Jonathan got his first injury in the NHL in 2008 when he sprained his knee while playing against the Los Angeles Kings. He missed 16 games due to the injury.</p><p>Despite playing really few games due to the injury, Toews was the top scorer among the rookies and finished second in line only behind fellow rookie <a href=#>Patrick Kane</a>.</p><p>Both of the players were selected for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year, and eventually, Toews finished second to Kane.</p><p>Looking at his successful rookie year, he was named the Captain of the Blackhawks in 2008.</p><p>He was 20 years when that happened, so this made him the third-youngest team captain in NHL history, only behind <a href=#>Sidney Crosby</a> and <a href=#>Vincent Lecavalier</a>. This record was later surpassed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jonathan-Toews-about-to-get-on-the-ice.jpg><p>The following season, he became a starting and Kane and Brian Campbell for the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, Quebec. He also helped the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup playoffs after 2002.</p><h3>Career this decade</h3><p>Since the beginning of the 2009-10 season, Toews received concussion-like symptoms since he was on the receiving end of the open ice hit from defenceman Willie Mitchell of Vancouver Canucks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jonathan-Toews-with-kids-1024x682.jpg><p>He agreed to extend the contract with the Chicago Blackhawks for five seasons with $6.5 million annually. That season, Toews finished with 68 points in 76 games.</p><p>Toews went on to record his career-high hattrick and two assists and led the Blackhawks to win the first-ever Stanley cup in the Franchise’s history since 1961 by winning against the Philadelphia Flyers in Finals.</p><p>He became the second-youngest captain in NHL history to win the Stanly Cup. He also won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.</p><p>When he won the Stanley Cup, he also became the youngest captain in history to be a part of the Triple Gold Trophy, which consists of Olympic gold, the Stanley Cup, World Championship.</p><p>Toews narrowly missed playing in the 2012 All-Star Game due to an injury incurred during a game with the Nashville Predators and hence was replaced.</p><p>He returned to play at the playoffs and played brilliantly, scoring the overtime and send Chicago back for Game 6, but they eventually were eliminated from the playoffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jonathan-Toews-with-a-young-Fan.jpg><p>Toews was back in his top form in 2013. Jonathan was active in helping the Blackhawks win the President’s Trophy by helping his team have the best regular-season records.</p><p>He was also named the top defensive forward and was awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy and named the NHL Second All-Star Team.</p><h3>International Performance</h3><p>Toews captained Canada in 2005 for the World U-17 Hockey Challenge and won a gold medal for the country by scoring the game-winning goal.</p><p>Jonathan Toews also played in Canada’s Juniors team at the 2006 World Junior Championships.</p><p>Toews was the youngest player on the team and helped the team win yet again. He was selected and won the competition again in 2007. He earned a second-straight&nbsp;World Junior gold medal.</p><p>Toews scored three times in the shootout to advance to the final in the tournament semi-final against the United States.</p><p>Toews made his debut in the senior 2007 World Championship before even turning professional.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jonathan-Toews-for-Canada-1024x862.jpg><p>Jonathan Toews also played in the 2009 Winter Olympics for Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia.

It all turned out to be well, considering that he actually won the Stanley Cup later that year.</p><h3>Latest News about Jonathan</h3><p>EA sports selected him to be on the cover of their video game NHL 10 and NHL 11 and his teammate <a href=#>Patrick Kane</a>.</p><p>It was also the first time that two people from the same team were featured on the cover two years in a row.</p><p>The province of Manitoba decided to name its northern lake after Toews for his tremendous efforts in sports and to make his hometown proud.

Talking about his International plays, David allied with Hockey Canada as a member of the national under-18 team.&nbsp;</p><p>David was named to the roster for the&nbsp;2007 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament on August 8, 2007.&nbsp; There is also an interesting story about him while he was busy with making his mateur career.</p><p>At Shattuck-Saint Mary, David with his teammate Kelsey Tessier left the team and school after being dismissed for cheating. Actually, he had to appear for a Chemistry and just before that he got a notebook that had accurate answers.</p><p>While giving the exam, David was all worried about running out of time while led him to write word-for-word answers. Moving further his professor noticed the similarities between Davids’ answers and those of the old test.</p><p>And henceforth, David got suspended and moved to &nbsp;Superior,&nbsp;Colorado&nbsp;to play for the Colorado Outlaws midget “AAA” team of the&nbsp;Midwest Elite Hockey League.</p><h3>Jonathan’s Earnings</h3><p>With the success that Jonathan has achieved along with the fame he has reached, he has become a wealthy man with an estimated net worth of $26 million.</p><h2>Jonathan Toews – FAQs</h2><h3>Does Jonathan Toews have social media?</h3><p>Jonathan Toews is only on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><h3>Is <a href=#>Devon Toews</a> related to Jonathan Toews?</h3><p>No, Devon is not related to Jonathan.
