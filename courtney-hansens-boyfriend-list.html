People born in the year of the tiger are self-sufficient and have great self-esteem. They adore being the defender and leader of ordinary people. They are passionate about justice and will never give up an argument. Their main flaw is their recklessness, which causes them to fail. They never, however, genuinely fail. Tigers will always find a way to recover and triumph in the end.</p><p>People born on October 2 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Libra</strong>. Libra energy is defined by balance, harmony, and fairness. Libra, as a cardinal air sign, is symbolized by the scales (interestingly, the sole inanimate item in the zodiac), a relationship that symbolizes Libra's obsession with achieving equilibrium. Libra is preoccupied with symmetry and tries to find balance in all aspects of life, especially in matters of the heart.</p><p>Famous for hosting the Spike TV show Powerblock; the TLC programs Million Dollar Motors, Rides, and Overhaulin’ and the Fox Sports Net show Destination Wild, she is also notable for her modeling work, as well as for her auto-themed “Courtney Hansen: Full Throttle” newspaper column.
