And if you haven't told someone you love them, do it now."</p><p></p><h2>Dakota Johnson snaps at Ellen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000600171301.jpg><p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Dakota Johnson</a>&nbsp;in 2019,&nbsp;Ellen&nbsp;confronted the Fifty Shades star <a href=#>about not being invited to her birthday party</a>.</p><p>“How was the party? I wasn’t invited," Ellen quipped.</p><p>"Actually, no, that’s not the truth, Ellen,” Dakota then announced to the audience's delight. “Last time I was on the show, last year, you gave me a bunch of s**t about not inviting you, but I didn’t even know you wanted to be invited."</p><p>For once, Ellen appeared to be lost for words on her own show:&nbsp;“Well, who wouldn’t want to be invited to a party?” she asked.</p><p>“Well, I didn’t even know you liked me,” Dakota replied, to the presenter's horror.</p><p>“Of course I like you. You knew I liked you," Ellen then said, before an incredibly awkward silence.</p><p></p><h2>Celine Dion defended her sons after Ellen made fun of their hair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000600000714.jpg><p>In a 2007 interview, Ellen and Celine Dion gushed over her son, Renee-Charles.</p><p>When Ellen shared her son, she asked the singer why she hadn't bothered cutting his hair, to which she replied: "Do you have a problem with that?</p><p>"You know, I have to say it's amazing right, some people shave the head of the children and they say 'Isn't that terrible'.</p><p>"I don't even cut my son's hair and they say 'Oh when are you going to cut his hair?'</p><p>"Whatever I will do, I won't please everyone. I can assure every mother here, Renee-Charles makes his own decisions."</p><p></p><h2>Ellen pretends Kylie Jenner's hair is a horse</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000652951479.jpg><p>When <a href=#>Kris</a> and Kylie Jenner visited Ellen in 2019, the young mom kept playing with her long ponytail, which had Ellen intrigued.</p><p>She asked her: "What's going on? Are you going to jump rope with that? Look how long that is!"</p><p>Ellen then proceeded to pull on <a href=#>Kylie's</a> hair, who told her "it's not mine," as the host said: "Stormi could jump rope."</p><p>Kylie then proceeded to say that Stormi had indeed been playing with it and she told her to stop it before quickly pulling her ponytail out of Ellen's hands.</p><p></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>Caitlyn Jenner and Ellen get into discussion about same-sex marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000652951474.jpg><p>In 2015, <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a> sat down with Ellen to talk about her poltical views, especially gay marriage.</p><p>The former Olympic star told the host: "When the issue of gay marriage came up, I was not for it, I'm a traditionalist.</p><p>"I kinda like tradition, you know, it's always been a man and a woman and I'm thinking I don't get it but as time has gone on, my thinking changed and I don't ever want to stand in front of anybody's happiness.</p><p>"If that word marriage is really that important to you, I can go with it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ellen then called her out and said that she was still not on board with it, explaining that she stands by equality and wanting to use the word marriage.</p><p>As a hit back, Ellen then asked Caitlyn if she was attracted to men and women, considering she was a traditionalist.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqaGyBen%2BQaJylpJWjeqWxxp6lnqqVqHq0tM6wZKygn5i4qrrGZqSopZWjwbR5wKyfraeeYri2wMKhnKtlnqqxpns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fellen-degeneres-show-shocking-moments-ashton-kutcher-nude.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fellen-degeneres-show-shocking-moments-ashton-kutcher-nude.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fellen-degeneres-show-shocking-moments-ashton-kutcher-nude.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fellen-degeneres-show-shocking-moments-ashton-kutcher-nude.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fellen-degeneres-show-shocking-moments-ashton-kutcher-nude.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fellen-degeneres-show-shocking-moments-ashton-kutcher-nude.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-ex-girlfriend-kristen-zang.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-ex-girlfriend-kristen-zang.html>Who Is Kristen Zang?
