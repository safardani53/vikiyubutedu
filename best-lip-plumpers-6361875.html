But if you want to avoid the doctor’s chair and achieve a voluptuous pout at home, then you may want to give lip plumpers a shot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With so many plumping products on the market, it’s hard to know which product is right for you. “[The] best ingredients to look for are hyaluronic filling spheres and vitamin E, and [be sure to] avoid <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>parabens</a> and sulfates,” says celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Tobi Henney</a>, known for glamming stars like Megan Fox and Ashley Graham for the red carpet (plump lips included).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With lip plumper often comes a tingling sensation, a result of the plumping agents within the product reacting to your skin. Henney states that you “should feel a little, as that will mean the plumping effect is working.” However, this should never hurt or be uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From sheer and pigmented shades to glosses and balms, there is an overwhelming amount of options to choose from. That’s why we took to the PEOPLE Testing lab to see which product reigns as the best once and for all. We tested 27 popular lip plumpers to evaluate their feel, ingredients, plumping ability, hydration, and finish.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best lip plumpers that PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-too-faced-lip-injection-maximum-plump-extra-strength-lip-plumper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Too Faced Lip Injection Maximum Plump Lip Plumper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Too Faced Lip Injection Maximum Plump Extra Strength Lip Plumper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8DT_7Pi4_nWXjRHF7a_g_TNC4CI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Too-Faced-Lip-Injection-Maximum-Plump-Extra-Strength-Lip-Plumper-66c199e948db48318b1502c09a61fe9b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This lip plumper gave us the longest-lasting pout (we rarely had to reapply).</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We saw the most physical plumping effects with this product.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The formula was never sticky or clumpy on our lips.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When a product is named “Lip Injection Maximum Plump Extra Strength Lip Plumper,” you know it’s going to put in the work. This gloss from Too Faced scored five out of five stars for its plumping ability when we tested it in the PEOPLE lab, a score that was unrivaled (except for one other product by the same brand). Right off the bat, this product significantly and visibly plumped our lips, making them look fuller than they had originally. On top of that, we got a much longer wear time out of this tube than the others. Available in five glossy shades, ranging from shimmery formulas to high-shine finishes, this plumper was the star of the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We do want to warn you about the tingling sensation, however, as this plumper really does what it says. The formula is made with “max-plumping technology” that made our lips a bit sensitive. While you won’t feel that annoyingly sticky texture, you may feel the burning sensation that comes with it — so proceed with caution.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But despite having a potentially uncomfortable tingling formula, its hydrating properties quickly erase any irritation. We were left with soft lips after wearing the plumper for a prolonged period of time, which made our lips look even more supple than before. Living up to its name, we can confirm that this is the most intense plumper we’ve tried yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>5 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Shimmery gloss, high shine | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.14 ounce (mini size: 0.10 ounce)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-elf-cosmetics-lip-plumping-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elf Cosmetics Lip Plumping Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Walmart e.l.f.

We were surprised by how noticeably smooth and hydrating this gloss was, leaving our lips moisturized long after the product had faded away thanks to its vitamin E and coconut oil-infused formula. Its cooling sensation was strongly preferred over the tingling feeling that many other plumpers provided, which made this one much more pleasant to wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, because of this softer sensation, the plumping result was more subtle than the others we tried. While our lips certainly looked fuller and juicier, we did think they could stand to be a little poutier than they were after 15 minutes of wear (when it should have taken full effect). If we have one small complaint it’s that this product doesn’t come in a clear gloss for everyday wear. However, due to its selection of buildable colors and very reasonable price tag, this e.l.f. product is a great option for those who are just starting to experiment with plumpers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Even as the months fly by, we’re still reaching for this plumper for everything from dinner and drinks to everyday errands. Its plumping sensation is so light on our lips that we’ve been replacing our everyday glosses with it. Though it’s meant to manipulate the fullness of our lips, we’ve never felt discomfort from using it as many times as we need throughout the day (though it’s pretty long-lasting, so we really only need to reapply two to three times a day). While we do wish it produced a more dramatic plumping effect than it does, we can’t complain about the pretty color options and, of course, the price point. (Plus, it’s small enough to throw in even our smallest purses, so what’s to not like?)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>10 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Sheer gloss with pigment | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.09 ounce</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-patrick-ta-major-volume-plumping-lip-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hydrating</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patrick Ta Major Volume Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patrick Ta Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/K_7tmvqdY2E5-tnAAb-WrnnYtAA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patrick-ta-major-volume-plumping-lip-gloss-46e0ee384e0445bfbc2648395ac73071.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This product packs major plumpness and shine.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its natural plumping ingredients produce a tingling sensation that doesn’t burn or irritate.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The formula is pumped with peptides that give our lips more volume while nourishing our skin barrier.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a plumper that’s going to double as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip mask</a>, then the Patrick Ta Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss is the product for you. Right away, we noticed the initial stickiness and tingling sensation of the product but felt both of these effects die down as the 15 minutes of wear time went on. We felt like we could keep this plumper on all day and not have to reapply lip balm from how moisturizing it was — almost akin to a mask. We’d go so far as to say that you probably don’t even need to apply lip balm before putting this on because it’s just that good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula is infused with natural ingredients like cinnamon and ginger to safely plump your lips, which we prefer to the chemically-induced burning sensations that some products produce. It’s also packed with hydrating and nourishing peptides that support delicate lip skin and make the lips shine. However, we felt like we needed to apply several layers to notice a difference in the fullness of our lips. Aside from that, the hydrating effects of the gloss and color selection were enough to prove this plumper’s worth. In the end, this plumper was one of our favorites and really did what it said it would — bringing “major volume.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>We couldn’t sing more praises for the luscious gloss that is the Major Volume plumper from Patrick Ta. Even after months of use, we still find ourselves enamored with the fullness and moisturization that this formula provides us, doubling as both a volumizing gloss and a nourishing mask. We’ve done everything from wearing it alone to layering it on top of our lip liners — we can’t decide on a favorite way to use it because it’s all so good. For its reasonable price, hydrating properties, and long-wearing results, we think this plumper is worth every penny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>5 | <strong>Finish: </strong>High-shine gloss | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.30 ounce</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-payoff-tarte-maracuja-juicy-lip-plump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Color Payoff</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Gc9mEYCbUt_IcocuTp7xpEBqghg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-80d486529ce746e2a5987e2a856cb700.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>This lip plumper comes in a ton of different flattering shades.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its maracuja oil-infused formula smooths and firms your lips while adding a high-shine finish.</p></li><li readability=1><p>There is no stinging or burning sensation, just a fresh, minty feeling.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most lip plumpers are oftentimes made as gloss formulas, but rarely do you see them in a balm, pseudo-lipstick form. What makes this plumper from Tarte different is the lipstick-like tube that you click at the bottom to push the product up, serving as a balm, gloss, and color all in one. And with a wide selection of glossy shades, it’s impossible to not talk about the great color payoff that this plumper provides. One swipe of the plumper gives off a sheer, moisturized look, while two coats produce a glossy finish — a feat almost unheard of from a lipstick consistency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to the product’s plant-based formula, the plumping agents produced a subtle minty tingle on our lips (far preferable to burning or stinging). We were also impressed by the way the infused maracuja oil moisturized and smoothed our lips, serving as a gloss, balm, and volumizer all in one. However, we do think that the hydrating effects outweighed the plumping — our lips were significantly more moisturized, but we can’t say they were exceptionally plump. But if you’re looking for subtle fullness and a juicy lip, then this Tarte stick is the one for you. (However, keep in mind that you’ll need to replenish your supply of this plumper frequently as the tube does not hold much product.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Months have gone by and yet one thing stays the same: we love this product. While the plumping effect isn't massive, we think it leaves a nice color behind while also nourishing the skin barrier with its high-shine formula. We continue to throw this in our bags for everything from the office to drinks with friends because of how easy it is — no stickiness or burning, just moisturization and long-wearing color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>11 | <strong>Finish: </strong>High-pigment shine | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.095 ounce</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-application-lorac-holy-lips-plumping-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Application</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lorac Holy Lips Plumping Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LORAC Holy Lips Plumping Serum Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1JlF7HwAbcgIxZljOXraJV0AL20=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lorac-holy-lips-plumping-serum-lip-gloss-d31c3cd6250b49988901cfc40c7c2f06.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The plush applicator easily contours to the shape of your lips.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its golden hue is ideal for achieving the illusion of larger lips.</p></li><li readability=0><p>We only noticed a slight tingle and never felt discomfort or irritation after applying this formula.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Lorac Holy Lips Plumping Serum was a top contender for many reasons, but the standout quality of this product was the doe-foot applicator. This teardrop-shaped tip was great for strategic coverage, contouring to the shape of our lips and highlighting our cupid’s bows without making a mess. We saw real results when we swiped on this golden gloss, partly due to the formula’s plumping agents and partly due to the honey hue that made our lips appear more dimensional. After applying, we felt a slight tingle, but no discomfort or irritation. To add to the ever-growing list of pros, this plumper is also pretty affordable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product was one of the few that we really thought made a difference in the fullness of our lips — though the end result wasn't drastic. However, the hydration this plumper provided was a perk, as the serum left our lips feeling moisturized long after wiping it off. Also of note: the scent — like glazed doughnuts — may not be appealing to everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>After using this plumper for six months, we’ve found ourselves gravitating towards it for nice events, special occasions, and weekends out — basically whenever we want to elevate our appearances a little more. The gloss has remained pretty and pouty when we swipe it on, giving us a little bit of fullness sans the tingling sensations that we don’t love. If you’re looking for a plumper that you could wear every day (you don’t have to be like us and wait for a special occasion), then this could be a great option for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Neutral, shiny gloss | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.16 ounce</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shade-range-too-faced-lip-injection-power-plumping-lip-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Shade Range</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Too Faced Lip Injection Power Plumping Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Too Faced Lip Injection Power Plumping Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Vl7jwOyH1FcG6bqQY7OZYjN299Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign1-f68313cffc0c41599f2b399354a1513d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>This plumper comes in shimmer, glitter, and high-shine finishes.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We were left with noticably fuller pouts after swiping on this gloss.</p></li><li readability=0><p>A little goes a long way, making this a worthwhile buy.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in a wide range of shades with your choice between shimmer, glitter, and high-shine finishes, this paraben-free gloss from Too Faced gives you a plethora of options to play with. Because of its wide variety, there are endless ways to wear this plumper. Whether you’re layering a lighter color atop a darker lip liner for some dimension or wearing a monochromatic look, you’re bound to see some pigment (and plumping power) when you wear this lip. We loved how pretty this gloss was on our lips, especially when we tried fun hues and finished, and appreciated its thin consistency and hydrating feel. Be forewarned: The shiny look comes at a small cost — it feels a bit sticky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But not unlike the other products out there, we felt that this gloss was not incredibly plumping (but then again, you can only do so much without a doctor’s visit). Overall, we could achieve a cute, pouty look that gave us a little more volume than our average glosses could. We can thank not only the plumping agents within the formula but the tinted gloss for that, as the high-shine formula helps create the illusion of fuller lips sans needles. It’s also a great value, as you only need to apply a little to get great results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>We’re still gravitating towards this gloss even after six months due to its slight plumping effect and beautiful color payoff. Though it does have a consistent tingling sensation, it’s nothing that keeps us from wearing it throughout the week or causes irritation of any kind. Though much time has passed we’re still not running low on our tubes, which makes us think that this product is definitely worth the money. In fact, we’re already picking out which shades we’re buying next.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>16 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Three types - shimmer, glitter, and high shine glosses | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.22 ounce</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-non-sticky-make-up-for-ever-ultra-hd-lip-booster></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Non-Sticky</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Lip Booster</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Lip Booster" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bEAK9J6D24oJxzteSlXVANm_IBU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign2-f3d1be6f305a48f893371d4e7d7a5adf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kohl's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Plumping Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The formula felt and looked smooth as glass on our lips.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite its plumping effect, there were no tingling or burning sensations.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s very easy to layer this formula over another lip product.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Expecting a smooth formula and getting a sticky gloss is never a great experience, and luckily, that’s not the case with this product from Make Up For Ever. In fact, this gloss glides on so buttery smooth that we kept forgetting we had it on. Another notable quality about this plumper is the absence of the trademark tingle – a comfortable, yet initially concerning characteristic that made us wonder if it was even working.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To our surprise, the plumper was, in fact, doing its job in stealthy silence. After about 15 minutes of wear time, we peeked in the mirror to find more accentuated, pillowy pouts. However, the results weren't as noticeable as say, the Patrick Ta gloss or the Too Faced iteration. Although, visually, its high-shine finish helped trick the eye, reflecting the light so our lips looked especially plush.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product comes in two shades — clear and light pink — and is easy to layer over another lip product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Six months later, we’re still fans of this easy product. With one swipe on the top and bottom lips, we’re seeing fuller results with zero pain or irritation in the process. As we near the end of the tube, we noticed that the formula is getting a bit tackier, but it’s still not affecting the end result or consistency of this plumper once it's on. Beauty lovers going for a subtly fuller shape to their lips will love this lightweight yet high-shine plumper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>2 | <strong>Finish: </strong>High shine gloss | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.20 ounce</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-lip-plumper></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Lip Plumper</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As it is with all beauty products, the formula is a huge factor to consider when buying new makeup. There are many ingredients to look out for when purchasing a lip plumper, such as hyaluronic filling spheres and vitamin E, according to Henney (which you can find in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">e.l.f. Cosmetics Lip Plumping Gloss</a>, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump</a>, and more). Henney also recommends steering clear of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>sulfates</a>, which are potentially irritating ingredients. Another formulaic aspect to consider is the consistency you are looking for — whether it be heavy plumping with the accompanying tingling sensation or a light pucker with a minty-clean feel. A lip plumper with sun protection is also a good addition to your summer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>SPF makeup</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hydration</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though you may use lip plumpers just as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip gloss</a>, many use them to prep the lips as well for a fuller base. In this case, it’s vital to choose a moisturizing lip plumper that can nourish the lips while simultaneously providing that pout. While all our picks gave us lusciously moisturized pouts, we thought that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Patrick Ta’s Major Volume Plumping Lip Gloss</a> was the most hydrating lip plumper thanks to its formula of skin-loving peptides. Sticky formulas often lack moisturization, so be sure to select a plumper that feels weightless and smooth. Alternatively, you can also just go with a lightweight gloss that's completely moisturizing with a little plumping effect, such as Cool Gloss from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jones Road Beauty</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Finish</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We all go for different makeup looks on a day-to-day basis, as different events call for different glam. However, the most common finishes you can find when it comes to lip plumpers are shimmer, glitter, and high shine (you can even find all three in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Too Faced Lip Injection Power Plumping Lip Gloss</a>). The latter is ideal for everyday or formal events, whereas shimmer and glitter finishes are great for a night out or anything that warrants getting a little dressed up.

Aiding us in this quest was celebrity makeup artist Tobi Henney, who shared the wisdom she’s gained over years of celebrity makeup on the dos and don’ts when it comes to lip plumpers.&nbsp;</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Application: </strong>We began by researching and compiling 27 of the most popular lip plumpers on the market to test in our PEOPLE Tested lab. Once our products were in, it was time to get glammed. We came into the room with makeup and product-free lips and had our pictures taken for the textbook “before” images. Next, we applied the product of choice to our lips, observing how it felt and looked on our lips. We then waited for 15 minutes to let each plumper fully work its magic, taking stock of the progress we observed and evaluating the end result. This is when we snapped the “after” picture — making for a great side-by-side.</li><li><strong>Hydration: </strong>After 30 minutes, we wiped the lip plumper off and noticed how hydrated our bare lips looked and felt. We rated each category, from overall feel to plumping abilities and hydration, on a scale from one to five (one being the lowest-performing rating and five being the highest) and left our thoughts and feelings on how each performed in the end.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Testing: </strong>But we didn’t stop there — after our lab test was done, it was time to send the lip plumpers home with a new group to get another person’s opinion on how each product performs long-term. Over the course of six months, we checked in at the one-, three-, and six-month marks to share information about how each lip plumper continued to fare (or fell short in the process). We used these insights and updated each product with a “how it’s held up” section to rehash these feelings with you all so you know what you’re getting yourself into.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-4378e4a3-68ce-49e7-840c-02cb04e35414></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50.027383863081><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98392282958199><p><span class=accordion__title>How does lip plumper work?</span></p><p>Lip plumpers provide that pouty, pillowy look by way of mild irritants in the formula that deliver temporary results without actually causing inflammation to your skin. Jeanine Lobell, celebrity makeup artist and founder of Stila and Neen, calls out peppermint, cinnamon, and caffeine as a few natural ingredients that will provide that tingly pout. Lobell also recommends lip plumpers with hyaluronic acid and shea butter for hydration and peptides which she says increase existing collagen in the lips for added plumpness in the long run, too. While all of these ingredients are generally safe, people who are prone to allergies or have sensitive skin should exercise more caution when trying these products, as they are more susceptible to irritation. Avoiding these ingredients entirely, you could try a product like Gloss Drip from the popular <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kylie Cosmetics</a> line to achieve the look of plumper lips.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98428290766208><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you use lip plumper every day?</span></p><p>"All lip plumpers are safe to use several times a day, every day if you don’t have a reaction to the ingredients," says Lobell. Just like with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip oils</a>, many plumpers also include moisturizing ingredients that lock in hydration, which can make them more comfortable for all-day wear. If you start to feel more irritation than a faint tingle, then we wouldn't recommend continual use — but if you don't, feel free to apply lip plumper as many days in a row as you'd like.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.93625498007968><p><span class=accordion__title>How long does lip plumper last?</span></p><p>You can expect to get a maximum of two or three hours of effect from a plumping gloss.

And by the way, companies can never buy our recommendation: Their products must earn it, fair and square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, PEOPLE Tested provides recommendations you can trust — every day, every purchase.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5KawLV5y6KnZqicqrqxsdGsZG9rZmaFeIE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-lip-plumpers-6361875.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-lip-plumpers-6361875.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-lip-plumpers-6361875.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-lip-plumpers-6361875.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-lip-plumpers-6361875.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-lip-plumpers-6361875.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./luis-coronels-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./luis-coronels-girlfriend-list.html>Who is Luis Coronel Dating Luis Coronel's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./red-velvet-cookies-recipe-valentines-day-dessert-sallys-baking-addiction.html>Red Velvet Cookie Recipe; Red Velvet Recipes; Valentines Day Desserts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./red-velvet-cookies-recipe-valentines-day-dessert-sallys-baking-addiction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
