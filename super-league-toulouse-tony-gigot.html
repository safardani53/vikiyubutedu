So I went home to Avignon and played with my friends.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">THE LATEST IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>“Players worked all day and trained two or three times a week but it made me happy.</p><p>“I just wanted to get back playing and enjoying rugby league again. After Toronto and with Covid-19, my love dropped a little.</p><p>“It’s my passion, though and it grew again as I played alongside my friends and had fun with little pressure on the results. It made me think how lucky I was but I needed to push myself.</p><p>“The opportunity at Toulouse came along, I grabbed it and now I’m back in Super League.</p><p>“Losing Johnno was big, especially just before the season’s start but as players we just have to look after our own jobs, that’s the best thing we can do.</p><p>“Different things happen every year – be it an injury or as has happened in recent years, Covid-19.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021___TO_XIII_vs_Rovers_028.jpg><p>“That’s been difficult to deal with. We had to close as a club for four days at one point as we had too many cases. We trained alone but it’s the same all over the world and we’re lucky to do what we do.”</p><p>Toulouse’s promotion, bringing Super League to France’s fourth largest city, was seen as a step in the right direction for the sport.</p><p>But in typical rugby league fashion, things got in the way. Now many feel Sylvain Houles’ men are relegation certainties.</p><p>However, despite the loss of big figures in the team – and not a great deal of recruitment – Gigot feels the talent and experience is still there to survive.</p><p>That may also see him keep the captain’s armband he had for his nation’s Test defeat to England in October.</p><p>The 31-year-old, who can play at full-back, in the halves or at centre, added: “Johnno leaving is an opportunity for another talented player to come in.</p><p>“We knew the season would be really tough anyway. We know if we’re to succeed in Super League, we’ll have to play a bit more expansively but hopefully we can stay there for a few years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DSC_0666.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH54gZhrb3BvX6jCsbHRZqOemZeqsm7Azq6jqK2jmnq1u82yZKChl6TBcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsuper-league-toulouse-tony-gigot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsuper-league-toulouse-tony-gigot.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsuper-league-toulouse-tony-gigot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsuper-league-toulouse-tony-gigot.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsuper-league-toulouse-tony-gigot.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsuper-league-toulouse-tony-gigot.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./france-switzerland-drummer-fan-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./france-switzerland-drummer-fan-video.html>Watch moment heartbroken France fan stops playing his drum as Switzerland grab shock lead in Euro 20</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./genevieve-parisi.html>Genevieve Parisi- Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./genevieve-parisi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
