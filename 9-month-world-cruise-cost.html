The very first cruise I dipped my toes into lasted a full two weeks and took us to Spain, Greece, Italy, and Egypt. The excursions off the ship were the stars of the show but for my money, the all-you-can-eat nearly 24-hour buffet was where the real fun began and ended. You simply haven't lived until you had a "free" chocolate fountain at your disposal for 14 days. I am extremely proud of my trash palate.</p><p><a href=#>Cruises definitely get a bad rap</a> and I think it's mostly rooted in ageism. For years they were geared towards older, retired people, but that ship has definitely sailed. There are now <a href=#>cruises designed for specific interests</a> such as the one I did in 2019 with a coworker where we interviewed Fred Durst. It was appropriately called ShipRocked. You can even sail all around the world if you have nine months of free time. Just how much does a nine-month world cruise cost? Hint: a lot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Cruise in dalmatia, 1920-30</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A nine-month world cruise definitely costs more than most people have.</h2><p>In October 2021, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line announced that in December 2023 they would offer what they called The Ultimate World Cruise. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN,</a> it's "designed to help travel-starved cruisers make up for lost time.'" That time was of course lost during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. What better way to celebrate leaving quarantine than by putting yourself on a ship for nearly a year, that you can't easily leave?</p><p>Prices vary depending on where in the ship one stays. The cheapest option will cost a single person $53,999, which doesn't include the "taxes, fees, and port expenses of $4,667 per person and are subject to change at any time," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Caribbean</a>. If this is all you can afford, you'll be staying in an interior stateroom which can run quite small and have zero windows. I did this on my first cruise, and boy was it a mistake. If you're claustrophobic, skip it.</p><p>The most expensive room listed is a junior suite. I've stayed in one of these and if you can swing it, you're gonna want this for the balcony alone. You simply haven't lived until you've contemplated your existence overlooking miles of endless ocean while listening to Enigma's Return to Innocence. For this, you'll need $105,839 and no fear of heights. There are other suite options available but those must be so pricey, that Royal Caribbean suggests you call for details.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The cost of this trip has some perks involved. Fingers crossed one of them is a chocolate fountain. Royal Caribbean promises that regardless of the stateroom you stay in, "your fare includes Ultimate Cruise segment complimentary amenities like Deluxe Beverage Package, gratuities, VOOM internet package, and wash and fold laundry service." If you don't want to do the full nine-month journey, you can join during segments such as the Ultimate Asia Pacific Cruise or Ultimate Europe and Beyond Cruise.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where does the Royal Caribbean nine-month world cruise go?</h2><p>The world is a big place and luckily there's a ton of water a person can cruise on. "The adventure begins and ends in Miami, Florida, visiting all seven continents, 65 countries, over 150 ports of call, with 18 overnights and 11 World Wonders," per Royal Caribbean. I took a look at the itinerary and it's impressive. I got overwhelmed after two weeks on a cruise, so this is pretty intense.</p><p>Taking a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">peek at the itinerary</a> reveals that guests will basically be in a different place almost every day. Apart from the occasional cruising days, which is when all of your deep Enya-style thoughts will occur, you truly will see almost everything planet Earth has to offer. The only left to do is figure out how one packs for 274 days. I'm an over packer, so this would be a real problem for me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfbnquu82tn2avn6e5pXnCq6yiq5VisLC%2F0w%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f9-month-world-cruise-cost.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f9-month-world-cruise-cost.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f9-month-world-cruise-cost.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f9-month-world-cruise-cost.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f9-month-world-cruise-cost.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f9-month-world-cruise-cost.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./made-in-chelsea-surprising-side-hustle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./made-in-chelsea-surprising-side-hustle.html>Made in Chelsea stars reveal surprising side hustle after uniting off-screen</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chris-brown-dating-cydney-christine-karrueche-tran-friend-pic.html>[PICS] Chris Brown Dating Cydney Christine?
