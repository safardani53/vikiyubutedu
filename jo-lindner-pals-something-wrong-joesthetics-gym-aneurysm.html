It has been really sad in the gym ever since. People are still talking about it.</p><p>"His girlfriend has also not been here since it happened. Without him, it feels empty. It's like there is someone missing.</p><p>"He didn't visit on Friday and that was unusual. Then he didn't come on Saturday, too. We found out that night he had died. It's so sad."</p><p>Speaking outside the gym, Jo's pal Chris said the influencer was a "machine".</p><p>He told The Sun:&nbsp;"Jo was the fittest out of everyone at the gym.</p><p>"Nobody can understand how someone so fit and young can drop dead. It's shaken us all here, the thought it could happen to any of us."</p><p>Lindner&nbsp;accumulated a huge following on social media as a result of his impressive fitness routines - including more than eight million fans on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> and one million subscribers on <a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p>He underwent a sensational body transformation through workouts and a substantial diet - and&nbsp;<a href=#>became one of the biggest bodybuilders in the game</a>.</p><p>Just weeks before his death, Jo said he feared over-training would give him a&nbsp;<a href=#>heart attack</a>&nbsp;due to his rare muscular condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Jo suffered from&nbsp;<a href=#>rippling muscle disease</a>, where muscles are unusually sensitive to movement or pressure.</p><p>He told&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTuber Bradley Martyn</a>: "The heart is also a muscle, that’s my biggest concern that what if I get such a bad cramp that my heart gets a cramp.</p><p>"That makes me scared. That's why I'm staying away from bodybuilding <span id=a775bc2f-30fc-4533-a90d-0f9367ab279f class=suggested-link>competitions</span> too much.</p><p>"Because I would take all these diuretics and if I stop eating salt and drink a lot, and then stop drinking as well, you would pee everything out, and then you would take a diuretic as well on top and then you pee even more sodium out.</p><p>"I cannot exist really. I cannot even walk anymore."</p><p>Jo added that he was afraid of how this dehydration could potentially lead to heart issues.</p><p>And in his <a href=#>last Instagram post</a>, he revealed his struggles with Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT).</p><p>Along with a slideshow of four topless photos, the star wrote: "When I lost my gains because I went off everything for one year but then could not recover my own [testosterone] levels so went back on trt.</p><p>“Trust me I tried to stop but be aware it might have long term effects for your life. Trt is a big commitment keep that in mind."</p><p>His fans have continued flocking to the comment section of the post to&nbsp;<a href=#>pay tribute to the late athlete</a>.</p><p>Jo's girlfriend,&nbsp;Nicha, announced his tragic death on Saturday.</p><p>She wrote on Instagram: "He was in my arms... this is just happening too fast... three days ago he kept said that he had&nbsp;<a href=#>pain in his neck</a>... we didn't really realise it until it was too late.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"If your guys were to know him like I do… he is the most amazing and incredible person in this world."</p><p>Although the bodybuilder's&nbsp;<a href=#>cause of death has not been officially confirmed</a>, Nicha suggested he suffered an&nbsp;<a href=#>aneurysm</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-instagram-com-p-cmymnnopip-828907005-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zhZFyaXJtX5%2B8brjIp5unnaJivaK40maqqKWVqbWqusZmrqunnpx6q7vErKuhnaSesLR5xrKkZpmemsKzxdKmZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjo-lindner-pals-something-wrong-joesthetics-gym-aneurysm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjo-lindner-pals-something-wrong-joesthetics-gym-aneurysm.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjo-lindner-pals-something-wrong-joesthetics-gym-aneurysm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjo-lindner-pals-something-wrong-joesthetics-gym-aneurysm.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjo-lindner-pals-something-wrong-joesthetics-gym-aneurysm.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjo-lindner-pals-something-wrong-joesthetics-gym-aneurysm.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nick-faldo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nick-faldo.html>Nick Faldo Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jared-goff-net-worth.html>Jared Goff Net Worth [2023 Update]: Contracts &amp;amp; House</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jared-goff-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
