Before passing away in 1993, he did have one biological child.</p><p>Robin Christensen-Roussimoff is this kid. Jean Christensen, Andre’s former coworker in the wrestling industry, is the mother of Robin.</p><p>Early in the 1970s is when Jean and Andre first connected. Just a few years after they first met, Robin was born. Andre was largely absent from his daughter’s life for a number of reasons.</p><p>Both of them suffered as a result of this absence. At the end of his life, it was one of the wrestler’s biggest regrets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Robin_Christensen></span><strong>Early Life of Robin Christensen </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robin Christensen was born in the year 1979 in France.

Likewise, Robin Christensen-Roussimoff is her full name.</p><p>Speaking of his parents, they are his mother Jean Christensen, and his father Andre the Giant (Andre Rene Roussimoff). Her mother worked as a wrestling publicist, and her father was a well-known wrestler.</p><p>Sadly, in 2008, her mother passed away. Before that, on the evening of January 27, 1993, she lost her father. In a hotel in Paris, her father succumbed to congestive heart failure while he was sleeping.</p><p>However, on the morning of January 28, a chauffeur found her. His father was in Paris for the funeral of her grandfather.</p><p>She also hardly had any contact with her father.</p><p>She had only ever seen him five times. This held true despite sporadic news reports on television and in newspapers criticizing Andre’s fatherlessness.</p><p>Although she gave a few interviews about the subject when she was younger, she is reportedly still reticent to talk about her father in public.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robin_Christensen_Age></span>Robin Christensen Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Robin Christensen is currently 44 years old as of 2023, having been born in 1979.</p><p>In her journey through the years, she has not only carried the legacy of her wrestling icon father but has also embraced a role in managing the online world of Cyndi Lauper fandom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robin_Christensen_Career></span><strong>Robin Christensen Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Robin-Christensen.jpg><p>As a professional wrestler, Robin Christensen carries on her father’s legacy. In the year 2018, she worked on the documentary Andre the Giant, which was based on the life of her father.</p><p>Speaking more specifically about her father’s career, Andre was noted as the highest-paid wrestler in history at the time in the 1974 edition of the “Guinness Book of World Records.”</p><p>In the early 1970s, the well-known wrestler made $400,000 in a single year. Her father was a legendary wrestler who earned one of the highest salaries ever.</p><p>He amassed a sizable amount of wealth throughout his entire career and went nearly 15 years without losing. In his last will and testament, the wrestler gave his money to three people.</p><p>The caretaker and wife of his Ellerbe, North Carolina ranch received two-thirds of his father’s estate, with the remaining assets going to his only surviving child.</p><p>Additionally, she receives royalties from WWE because they occasionally still use Andre’s name for events.</p><p>The “Andre the Giant” name may be licensed in any format, such as video games or action figures, according to the celebrity daughter.</p><p>The famous author’s daughter was spotted promoting the book Andre the Giant: Closer to Heaven by Brandon M.

Her birth was therefore nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Likewise, she first met her father when she was a baby, then again when she was 4 years old, and finally briefly in 1991. She was also given the chance to visit her father’s ranch when she was ten years old.</p><p>Though she was afraid of leaving her mother and moving to a strange place to live with a man she hardly knew. Hence, she consequently declined to meet him.</p><p>Moreover, she hadn’t spoken to her father since Christmas of 1992.</p><p>Congestive heart failure claimed Andre’s life a month later. The news was only shared with her and her mother a month later.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>All About Candice Accola King’s Daughter’s Josephine June King</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robin_Christensen_Net_Worth></span><strong>Robin Christensen Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robin Christensen has an estimated net worth of $10 million as of 2023.</p><p>Her monthly income on average, when calculated, comes to around $10k and that’s only from her wrestling and royalties from WWE.</p><p>Her Net worth stood around $9.5 million USD as of &nbsp;2021 and she can hit the $15 million mark by 2025.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>All About Damon Wayans Jr.’s Daughter Aniya Wayans?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><strong>Physical Appearance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robin Christensen is 6 feet taller, which is equal to 182 centimeters.</p><p>Robin Christensen has a substantial build and weighs 96 kg (211 lbs).
