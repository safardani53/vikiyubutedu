Kat replied.</p><p>"Just a theory but do you think he knew?" another mused.</p><p>"That's why he turned up to show his tattoo to make it seem like he wasn't with her when she got hers."</p><p>"That's the only thing I can think of! Nothing else makes sense!" Kat responded.</p><p>And a third commented: "So your mom and brother were mocking you IN YOUR HOME."</p><p>"So he knew that she had an affair with your husband.. at least 4 weeks before you knew," someone else wrote.</p><p>In a previous video, Kat - who shares twin daughters with her ex - revealed she'd found out about the affair in February 2022.</p><p>She'd called her husband at 9.30pm one night to find out when he would be home from his shift as a food delivery driver.&nbsp;</p><p>She noted that his car was in a different area to the one he claimed he worked in when she spoke to him, and "all of a sudden, I heard a woman’s voice," she said.</p><p>She began challenging her husband on who he was with but he hung up the phone.&nbsp;</p><p>As she'd already had suspicions about her mother and husband's relationship due to the amount of time her mum, had been spending at her house, Kat had a "gut feeling" that it was her.</p><p>And that was confirmed when she called her sister to see if their mum was at home, only to find out that her husband had popped round earlier that night to pick up their mum but had begged her not to say anything.&nbsp;</p><p>After discovering the truth, she left the home straight away with her children.&nbsp;</p><p>The affair was short-lived, and her mum returned to Kat's dad after calling it off.</p><p>Her dad took her mum back, but Kat's relationship with her own husband was unrepairable.</p><p>"Please tell me you don't talk to your mum," someone else commented on the video.</p><p>To which Kat replied: "I haven't in almost 2 years!"</p><p>"But how’s your emotions after your husband and mother hooked up? You seem okay with it," another asked.</p><p>"It's been almost 2 years since this all happened so I've had some time to heal," Kat replied.</p><p>"I choose to not cry on camera if I can control it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"My mum slept with my UNDERAGE BOYFRIEND when I was in high school," another commented.</p><p>"I’m sorry this happened to you girlie, some mums suck."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/0739a2dc-1ed5-4b7c-8901-7dd6f931572a.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuZ25qYGh9cLnUpmSanpaWtrN5x66qm5memXq1rdOtpqhlpKe2o8HTnmScpKWauaa%2F0madqK2emXqwwdNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmum-affair-husband-tattoo-tribute-clueless-found-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmum-affair-husband-tattoo-tribute-clueless-found-out.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmum-affair-husband-tattoo-tribute-clueless-found-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmum-affair-husband-tattoo-tribute-clueless-found-out.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmum-affair-husband-tattoo-tribute-clueless-found-out.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmum-affair-husband-tattoo-tribute-clueless-found-out.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./savannah-jordan-joseline-hernandez-diss-pic-nappy-hair-photo-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./savannah-jordan-joseline-hernandez-diss-pic-nappy-hair-photo-instagram.html>See Pic Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lpbw-matt-roloff-brother-sam-show-offer-declined.html>Little People star Matt Roloff's brother Sam claims he turned down offer from TLC to join famous fam</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lpbw-matt-roloff-brother-sam-show-offer-declined.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
