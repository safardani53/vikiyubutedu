His son David arrived just a few years later in 1961.</p><p>While Kissinger's daughter, who is married and has one child, has preferred to stay out of the public eye, David is the opposite. In addition to speaking out publicly about his father's legacy, even penning a tribute to him for his 100th birthday for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, the only son of the at-times controversial figure has had a larger-than-life career of his own.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>David is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">president of Conaco</a>, <a href=#>Conan O'Brien</a>'s film and TV production company. He formerly worked for Disney and Universal TV.</p><p>The Hollywood executive has four children with his wife Alex Rockwell.</p><p>In part, David said about his dad back in May 2023, "My father’s longevity is especially miraculous when one considers the health regimen he has followed throughout his adult life. The other secret to my father’s endurance is his sense of mission."</p><p>"Although he has been caricatured as a cold realist, he is anything but dispassionate," David added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Henry Kissinger married twice — but was also somewhat of a Washington, D.C. lothario.</h2><p>Kissinger eventually settled down, but he was once the paramour of Zsa Zsa Gabor, and even became friends with Hugh Hefner.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, the diplomat was even nicknamed "Playboy of the Western Wing." Among the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities he wined and dined</a> was Candice Bergen, Shirley MacLaine, Marlo Thomas, and Diane Sawyer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kissinger even told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a> in 1972, “I go out with actresses because I’m not very apt to marry one.”</p><p>Instead, he said "I do" to Anneliese Fleischer in 1949, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Sun</a>. But that marriage didn't last, with the couple splitting up in 1964, nearly a decade before he would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">serve as Secretary of State</a>.</p><p>However, Fleischer is the mom of his two kids, David and Elizabeth.</p><p>Kissinger later wed Nancy Maginnes, who was also active in the political sphere, having served as an aid to New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. They did not have children together, but remained married from 1974 until the diplomat's death. She is still living at time of writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKvvthmoqKro567qLHRZpqhoZyZv6a6</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhenry-kissinger-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhenry-kissinger-children.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhenry-kissinger-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhenry-kissinger-children.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhenry-kissinger-children.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhenry-kissinger-children.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./endy-shelton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./endy-shelton.html>Endy Shelton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ben-affleck-buys-woke-up-sexy-as-hell-again-tshirt-with-jennifer-lopez-7570236.html>Ben Affleck Buys 'Woke Up Sexy as Hell Again' T-Shirt with Jennifer Lopez</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ben-affleck-buys-woke-up-sexy-as-hell-again-tshirt-with-jennifer-lopez-7570236.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
