An official statement for the Modern Family star’s absence was never released by NBC but reports claim she was committed to an acting job.</p><p>The actress also shared images of her downtime with her husband Joe Manganiello at their Caribbean vacation home over the new year.</p><p>Sofia, 50, will star as Colombian-based cartel leader Griselda Blanco in the upcoming <a href=#>Netflix</a> miniseries Griselda.</p><p>She has been keeping fans in the loop with her <a href=#>America’s Got Talent audition</a> updates, in which she called judging “the best job in the world”.

The White Chicks actor joined the AGT franchise in 2019’s season 14 after hosting America’s Got Talent: The Champions.</p><p>He took over from Tyra Banks after the latter reportedly left to focus on TV production. “I think I had a really nice run with AGT,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Access. “I had a lot, a lot of fun. I’m really focusing on Life Size. I’m going to be producing TV and I have a massive project starting next year.”</p><p>So far, Terry’s best moments include the time he busted out his flute to join the comedy music group Lewberger during their audition. In true Terry fashion, the host was shirtless and he only crashed the performance because the song literally told him to take his shirt off.</p><p>Crews also joined David Rush on stage in 2020 for an epic T-shirt-ripping race. The actor aimed to beat Rush’s world record of 30 shirts within one minute, but ultimately the contestant retained the crown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-america-s-got-talent-season-18-start-date-time-and-finale>America’s Got Talent season 18: Start date, time, and finale</h2><p>Season 18 will air on Tuesday, May 30, 2023 at 8pm ET on NBC. It will be available to stream on <a href=#>Peacock</a>.</p><p>The premiere will run for two hours long and the finale will arrive on September 20, 2023, meaning there are 16 total episodes.</p><p>You can vote via the official America’s Got Talent app; voting opens at the beginning of the show on Tuesdays and closes at 7am ET on Wednesdays.</p><p>The judge auditions began filming the weekend of March 25; although it is the first round available on TV, it is actually the second round of auditions within the process. Participants first perform in front of the casting team and producers. Interesting talents are then put through to executive producers before making it to the on-stage judge auditions.</p><p>Auditions filming typically takes around 23 days and backstage staff have no idea when the judges will use their Golden Buzzer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-the-previous-winner-now>Where is the previous winner now?</h2><p>Lebanese female alternative dance group, <a href=#>The Mayyas won America’s Got Talent</a> season 17. Their audition, which has over 24 million views, scored Sofia’s golden buzzer.</p><p>The dance team, choreographed by Nadim Cherfan, took home the $1 million prize money and has gone on to bigger things.</p><p>They performed with Beyonce at her highly-anticipated appearance at the Atlantis The Royal Dubai Hotel opening. Queen Bey was paid $24 million for her one-hour concert, likely because it was her first full performance in over four years.</p><p>The Mayyas recently worked on a collaboration with luxury brand Tiffany & Co and Marie Claire magazine.</p><p>All-Stars winner Aidan Bryant, meanwhile, has continued his career with AGT. He is among the line-up of show favorites for America’s Got Talent’s Las Vegas residency. Named America’s Got Talent Presents Superstars Live, the nightly performances showcase an ensemble of winners, finalists, and Golden Buzzer acts across the years.</p><p>The self-taught aerialist, 17, has also worked with Cirque Du Soleil and despite his dangerous performances, he has never fallen from his equipment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqa6tsc2tZKygn6zAcK3Mnqmim5Goeqi702armqSVo8Fufo9ramarlZbAsLqMam9mq6SWv7V5w5qrnmWaqrGosdJmmKecXZ28uHnMmqWyZZWltrS7w56q</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famericas-got-talent-2023-season-18-start-date-judges-and-how-many-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famericas-got-talent-2023-season-18-start-date-judges-and-how-many-episodes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famericas-got-talent-2023-season-18-start-date-judges-and-how-many-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famericas-got-talent-2023-season-18-start-date-judges-and-how-many-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famericas-got-talent-2023-season-18-start-date-judges-and-how-many-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famericas-got-talent-2023-season-18-start-date-judges-and-how-many-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hailey-bieber-green-lingerie-victorias-secret-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hailey-bieber-green-lingerie-victorias-secret-photos.html>Hailey Bieber Poses In Green Lingerie In New Victorias Secret Ad Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-james-arnold-taylor-dating.html>Who is James Arnold Taylor Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-james-arnold-taylor-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
