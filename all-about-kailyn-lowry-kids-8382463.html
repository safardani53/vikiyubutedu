At the time, she was expecting her first child, son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Isaac</a>, with her then-boyfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jo Rivera</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Lowry joined the cast of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Teen Mom 2</a>, which documented her turbulent love life and her growing brood of boys. In 2012, she married <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Javi Marroquin</a>, and a year later, the two welcomed their son, Lincoln.

In 2018, Lowry and Isaac attended <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rivera’s wedding</a> to Vee Torres, and the Teen Mom star later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>tweeted</a> that she "couldn’t ask for a better stepmom for Isaac."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from appearing on Teen Mom 2 with his mother, Isaac has also joined Lowry for an interview on her podcast, Barely Famous, in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Right now, I love playing piano,” he said of his interests. “I want to learn to play guitar like we talked about.” He went on to say that although he doesn’t love to practice, he enjoys playing basketball.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Isaac might also follow in Lowry’s publishing footsteps. “I want to be a writer,” he shared, adding that he’s hoping to write a memoir of his own one day, just like his mom.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jo Rivera, Isaac Rivera, and Kailyn Lowry.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kailyn Lowry Instagram&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lowry <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated Isaac's 13th birthday</a> in 2023 with a heartfelt <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram post</a>, calling him “a son, brother, friend.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We have literally grown up together, but in some ways he’s even more grown than I am,” she wrote. “Thoughtful, brilliant, funny and at times a smartass 😆 are a few words I would use to describe Isaac.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “He is curious and open-minded, he can form his own thoughts and opinions.

His birth came over a year after Lowry quietly wed ex-husband Javi Marroquin. While Lowry and Marroquin divorced in 2017, they've made an effort to prioritize parenting duties, agreeing to share 50/50 custody of their son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2022 episode of Barely Famous, Lowry described Lincoln as “sporty” and “athletic.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Lincoln's very much into sports,” she told the audience, adding that he’s especially into football and basketball.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During another episode, Lowry opened up about her son's soft side, calling him a "nurturer."

The pair broke up shortly after Lux was born and had an on-again, off-again relationship until 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s just kind of hard,” Lowry <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> of co-parenting with her children's three fathers in September 2017. “The dynamics are different between me and Chris, than with me and Javi [Marroquin] or me and Jo [Rivera]. It’s a different kind of co-parenting.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, Lowry has primarily raised Lux as a single mom. In 2018, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>came to her son's defense</a> and responded to mom-shamers on social media who made comments about the length of baby Lux's hair. “I’ll cut it when he tells me he wants to cut it.

What works for us is waiting until he’s ready.
