The TikTokers have been beefing after Ordway accused him of pressing to kiss him on camera.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It all started after the two appeared on Tommy Unold's hot tub stream on Twitch. And now, the two are going back and forth at each other on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here is everything you need to know about this messy situation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What Happened Between Bryce Hall and Faith Ordway?</h2><p>Ordway took to TikTok to expose Hall after people wondered why she left Tommy Unold's hot tub stream. Ordway left the stream before it began, and Hall said she left because she was mad.&nbsp;</p><p>He further said that she was angry at a "salty remark" that he could not share. Ordway said she left because "Bryce Hall is a trashbag human."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She explained on TikTok that Hall wanted her to kiss him on the stream for his YouTube video as clickbait. However, Ordway did not want to kiss him on the lips.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Therefore, she kissed him on his cheeks to "come to a common understanding." Her kissing his cheeks is currently the thumbnail for Hall's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a>&nbsp;titled 'WE DID THIS IN A HOT TUB!' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Towards the end of the video, she suggests if the two wanted to do shots off her body for content. The two boys were shocked by her suggestions and then revealed how she had denied giving Hall a peck on the lips.&nbsp;</p><p>For Tommy Unold's hot tub stream, Ordway did not want to "do anything sexual for entertainment." The boys told her she could do whatever she wanted.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She planned to make the stream humourous, and Tommy Unold told them they needed to end it with a bang. That was when Hall suggested Ordway kiss him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He called her names and said that all the girls who had done so had a successful career because of him. Hall told that Ordway had sent him a paragraph about wanting to be intimate with him on the stream.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she exposed the texts between her and Hall where there was no paragraph. She also asked his videographer to remove the thumbnail from his video, but Hall denied it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Bryce Hall's Response To Faith Ordway&nbsp;</h2><p>Hall stitched Ordway's TikTok and transitioned when she said she did not want to "do anything sexual for entertainment." Hall said it was understandable and then showed a video of Ordway twerking.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>&nbsp;that Ordway was lying for clout and said they both know what happened off the internet.</p><p>He implied she was trying to portray herself in a good light and said that "lying women like Faith Ordway try to create a false narrative to boost their 'career'."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Hall went on TikTok live and explained the situation. He said he had been spending nights with Ordway, and she was his "sneaky link."</p><p>Hall said that Ordway knew what she was going into since she had watched Tommy Unold's previous streams. He accused Ordway of pretending to be innocent online, but she was not.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He then said she was creating "false narratives online," and that he did not beg to kiss her. Hall pointed out that Ordway kissing him would get people talking about them.&nbsp;</p><p>He also said Ordway had told her many things, including her political views, to mess up her career. However, Hall said he would not reveal them because he was "a little bit mature." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On January 2, 2022, Hall uploaded TikTok videos addressing the situation again. He accused Ordway of "exposing guys" for monetary gain.</p><p>He admitted that the text he revealed on the stream was fake, and he told his videographer not to change the thumbnail for the video.&nbsp;</p><p>He ended his video implying that he was filing a defamation lawsuit against her for the false accusations.</p><p>Ordway responded to Hall and talked about consent. She accused him of pressuring her into doing something she was not comfortable with.</p><p>She admitted that she had hooked up with Hall previously, but she did not consent to kiss him on camera. Ordway also called out Unold for not supporting her.</p><p>She said she was not a bad person and would take a break from the internet for a while.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6RnsGpec6rm7CZqWLBsLnMsmSupp%2BhsW6u0bKanmWYlrmtesetpKU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffaith-ordway-tommy-unold-bryce-hall-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffaith-ordway-tommy-unold-bryce-hall-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffaith-ordway-tommy-unold-bryce-hall-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffaith-ordway-tommy-unold-bryce-hall-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffaith-ordway-tommy-unold-bryce-hall-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffaith-ordway-tommy-unold-bryce-hall-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kieffer-delp-son-jenelle-evans-boyfriend-secret-teen-mom-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kieffer-delp-son-jenelle-evans-boyfriend-secret-teen-mom-2.html>Kieffer Delps Son Jenelle Evans Ex Has a Secret Child!
