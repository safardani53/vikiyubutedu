<time>03 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A SEX cult survivor has bravely revealed how kids was encouraged to spend "alone time" with "uncles" and beaten in a spanking room in the notorious Children Of God sect.</p><p>Dawn Watson, 29, grew up in the cult – now known as Family International – but managed to escape when she was 13. Her journey to recovery has been long and plagued by painful memories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291746-e1515577582218.jpg><p>She said: "As you learned to brush your teeth as children, we learned to have sex: ‘This is what you have to do, this is how it happens.’</p><p>“We learnt God is love and the way to express God’s love is through sexuality. I never knew anything different from that.</p><p>“I think that no one will truly understand unless you have lived it, what abuse is. And abuse I say in all forms. Abused sexually, abused emotionally and abused spiritually.”</p><p>Dawn said she “cherished” her alone time, adding: “I think that was my escape. I used to have a dog called Midnight and he was the cutest thing and he had a big doghouse and I would sit down in that doghouse for hours and hours and just look at him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291739-e1515577656371.jpg><p>The Children Of God was started by David Brandt Berg in Huntington California in 1968. By 1972, there were 130 communities of full-time members scattered throughout the world - including Brazil where Dawn was raised.</p><p>Hollywood actors Rose McGowan and Joaquin Phoenix have both shared details of their own early childhood experiences in the sect.</p><p>Dawn said: “David Brandt Berg had a lot of darkness inside him. Before he even began this community he had problems with his own children. He used to abuse at his own children.</p><p>"He was kicked out of the church before starting this community because he wanted to have many wives. He didn’t know how to have one woman."</p><p>By the time Dawn was born into the cult, Berg was a shadowy figure who existed to the members through his teachings and status as Father David.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291727.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000000206155.jpg><p>Dawn recalls, as a child, being exposed to images of naked women nailed to crucifixes, and "Hookers for Jesus" captioned posters, produced by the sect.</p><p>It’s been reported the&nbsp;cult brainwashed its members into believing that being part of sex acts – even if they were at a young age and didn’t understand what they were doing - was all part of God’s expression of love.</p><p>Dawn said: “I never had any father figure growing up in the community. Not someone that as a man I could relate to and can feel was protective of me. I always looked at men and uncles of the community as danger and I wanted to be as far away as I could from them.”</p><p>Young women were sent outside of the community to solicit themselves – an act known as "flirty fishing" – to raise money for the commune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291763.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291631-e1515577812278.jpg><p>Dawn said: “He convinced the women so much that this was part of a cause and that if you didn’t want to do it, if you didn’t have the faith to do it, it was because you were weak spiritually.”</p><p>Questioning the ways of the community was frowned upon - and those that did were punished.</p><p>Dawn said: “A lot of the kids would get scotch tape on their mouth as in you don’t talk about things that are not of this culture or our belief systems. We had a spanking room that I was always in and out of.</p><p>“I remember one day, we were just kids being kids, and we ended up getting a punishment and I remember I got so many spankings that my whole leg was bruised and I remember going to my mom and saying: ‘Is this love?’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000363584360.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000363530473-e1509379293464.jpg><p>She said: “My mom definitely did not know many of the things that were happening; they always put her to go and sing and always gave her so many jobs to do.</p><p>“A lot of times women were not taking care of their own children. They were always with uncles and aunties.”</p><p>The children in the community weren’t given a real education, further trapping them in the cycle of abuse and brainwashing.</p><p>Dawn said: “We weren’t permitted a lot to study or read books or anything that was going to take our mind away from the education that they were giving us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000363584361.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291716.jpg><p>Frustrated with the lack of answers to her questions, Dawn started to sneak out at night, where she would listen to music.</p><p>One of the first songs she ever heard - other than one of Children of God’s own - was by Eminem.</p><p>Dawn couldn’t get rid of the unshakeable feeling that the so-called expressions of love in the community were not right, so she decided, age 13, to leave.</p><p>She said: “I finally got to a point in my life where I needed a way out. I desperately said: ‘You know what? If the outside world is a terrible place, if God is going to judge me and kill me and I am going to hell. I really don’t care.</p><p>“Leaving the community and having to figure out life in the outside world was really difficult, exciting, scary, bunch of different emotions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291834-e1515577952197.jpg><p>Dawn spent over three years staying at the homes of various ex-members in Brazil.</p><p>Believing she had closed the door on the darkest chapter of her life Dawn was then raped when she was 15.</p><p>She said: “I experienced rape in one of the houses that I was staying at. It was one of my darkest moments and it was at that moment I called up my mom and finally understood that she had found the strength to get out of the community.</p><p>"She was able to leave and I was able to come home. It was that feeling of ‘okay now we can start again and begin to construct a new life and I am not alone in this.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291721-e1515577978441.jpg><p>Reunited with her family, Dawn studied psychology – a considerable feat given that despite being born in Brazil she knew no Portuguese when she left Children Of God.</p><p>However, she still struggled to feel part of the world she’d been shut off from for so long.</p><p>Dawn explained: “I still wasn’t comfortable talking about where I had come from. There was a lot of gaps that people couldn’t understand. ‘Why do you have an accent?’ I was born in Brazil, but Portuguese was never my first language.</p><p>"Or they would talk about a television series or just normal things that were happening in Brazil. I had no idea. I felt like an alien in this world that I couldn’t connect to anything that people were talking about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377291731.jpg><p>“I ended up having to make up a story. Make up different background of where I came from. So that I can feel like I would fit in. But that began to really make me feel terrible inside, like I can never be me.”</p><p>In 2014, Dawn sold up most of her possessions to pay for a ticket to Date With Destiny, a self-help event led by entrepreneur and life coach Tony Robbins. There she publicly shared her story for the first time.</p><p>Dawn said: “At that moment for me it was, ‘I’ve been through so much pain, I’ve so much baggage’ I just need to liberate that within me.</p><p>"It was a very scary moment of my life but I started to receive emails and messages from men and women saying 'your story helped me deal with a pain that I was going through.’”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>Dawn has been able to rebuild not only her own life but others' lives, too. In 2016 she started her own non-profit, Dawn Watson’s Institute.</p><p>She said: “I take people that have gone through extreme amounts of pain and I help them go through the process that I’ve gone through in my life of forgiveness of emptying, of owning what they have.</p><p>“Helping people start to break the silence within themselves, what they went through. And then they can begin the process of healing.</p><p>“I think the way that I relate to my past, it really defines how people will relate to me. I felt like the more I am ashamed of my past, didn’t want to talk about it.</p><p>“But now I talk about it as ‘this is me and I am not ashamed of it. This is where I came from.”</p><p>Meanwhile,<a href=#> sex cult survivor&nbsp;Natacha Tormey has revealed how she&nbsp;was beaten into becoming a "soldier of Christ"</a>&nbsp;in preparation for the ‘Apocalypse’ in the terrifying Children Of God cult.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Inside Australia's notorious cult 'The Family' led by woman claiming to be Jesus</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5RsZ3BwaWt8pMHLrWSsraKrtre70WadqKqTmrFuwM5mp56qlqS%2FrnnSnq9mmZOpwG67zWasp5ucmsBuvNSnoKyglZl6qrqMmmSsqJGjuKq6xmapqKedYq6vsIysn6ivnmK2rq3Gnqpmp5Ziu6K3xJ1ksKedmrtuusCio56cXam8bq%2FRrpqinpmtsrR5yKdkrZ2ip7anxcinnmabmJ65pb7Ep2Sonl2cvKV50p6arWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcult-survivor-forced-to-perform-sex-acts-on-uncles-punished-in-a-spanking-room-and-shown-images-of-naked-women-nailed-to-crucifixes-in-terrifying-children-of-god-sect.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcult-survivor-forced-to-perform-sex-acts-on-uncles-punished-in-a-spanking-room-and-shown-images-of-naked-women-nailed-to-crucifixes-in-terrifying-children-of-god-sect.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcult-survivor-forced-to-perform-sex-acts-on-uncles-punished-in-a-spanking-room-and-shown-images-of-naked-women-nailed-to-crucifixes-in-terrifying-children-of-god-sect.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcult-survivor-forced-to-perform-sex-acts-on-uncles-punished-in-a-spanking-room-and-shown-images-of-naked-women-nailed-to-crucifixes-in-terrifying-children-of-god-sect.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcult-survivor-forced-to-perform-sex-acts-on-uncles-punished-in-a-spanking-room-and-shown-images-of-naked-women-nailed-to-crucifixes-in-terrifying-children-of-god-sect.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcult-survivor-forced-to-perform-sex-acts-on-uncles-punished-in-a-spanking-room-and-shown-images-of-naked-women-nailed-to-crucifixes-in-terrifying-children-of-god-sect.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./love-and-hip-hop-atlanta-recap-stevie-j-vs-joseline.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./love-and-hip-hop-atlanta-recap-stevie-j-vs-joseline.html>Karlie Redd OUTS Kirk Frost to Rasheeda!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lindsay-lohan-whats-her-best-hair-color.html>What's Her Best Hair Color?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lindsay-lohan-whats-her-best-hair-color.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
