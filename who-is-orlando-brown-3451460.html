Also in 2018, Brown was arrested for alleged felony drug possession and misdemeanor charges of drug paraphernalia, resisting arrest and obstructing a public officer, and for alleged battery against a spouse following a verbal confrontation with his girlfriend and his girlfriend’s mother.</p><h2><strong>Brown was sober as of December 2018.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>For years, Brown had issues with alcohol and drugs, specifically vodka, marijuana and crystal meth. At one point he admitted that he was selling crystal meth.

Brown even told Dr. Phil that he isn’t sure how old his children are either. “One is two, one is five, one is actually like 11, and the oldest is 16-18… Not sure until I get in front of their faces,” he said. Brown also admitted that he doesn’t know the names of all of his kids. “My 11-year-old’s name, I gotta figure that one out. But, if I had to name him anything, I’d be John,” Brown said. “I don’t know the 16-year-old’s name, but that’s what I plan on doing.” As of 2022, the kids would be 5, 9, 16 and 21.</p><h2><strong>He’s claimed he wants to marry his former co-star, Raven Symone.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Brown used his Dr. Phil interview as an opportunity to talk about his desire to marry <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Symone</a>, 37, who he says he has a good relationship with. “I want to marry her.
