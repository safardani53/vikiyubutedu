"This is the time of year that us veterinarians see a lot of what we call 'garbage gut.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Feeding your animals table food is among the most common mistakes pet owners make around the holidays. Despite it being the season of giving, sharing sweets and treats with your dogs and cats should be avoided.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The holidays are also a time of environmental change around the house, between the flashy decorations and loud crowds of people entering the home. These changes can be overwhelming for pets; Dr. Harrison says they might "start showing or expressing new behaviors" as a result.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for expert tips and tricks to keep your pets safe this holiday season, according to Dr. Harrison's advice.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-feed-your-pet-table-food></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't feed your pet table food</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dog looking at cookies on the table.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your freshly baked Christmas cookies are so good you want to share them with everyone; however, Dr. Harrison says that "there are foods that we eat as humans that can actually be toxic to dogs and cats."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Therefore, she says "it's important to remember not to give table food" to your pets in order to prevent the previously mentioned "garbage gut." Since the majority of human foods can be "very irritating to the GI tract of our dogs and cats," she stresses you stick to the usual diet your veterinarian recommends for your pets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Among the "dangerous foods" Dr. Harrison says to be mindful of around your pets are garlic, onions, leeks, chives, chocolate, alcohol, grapes and raisins. She also notes yeasted dough as another when it comes to bread.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anything with that yeasted dough can have some rawness to it and we always want to be careful," she explains. "Let's also make sure that we're putting our coffee or our soda up high because they absolutely can get a caffeine toxicity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sugarless candy, too, she adds to the list. "Some gums and toothpaste have something called xylitol and that can cause liver failure, so we want to make sure that we're standing clear of sugarless candy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more information on the foods and drinks to keep away from your pets around the holiday season, Dr. Harrison recommends owners check out the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ASPCA poison control website</a> for an even more comprehensive list.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-give-your-pets-ham-bones-to-chew-on></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't give your pets ham bones to chew on</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dog in Santa hot looking at bone.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Believe it or not, Dr. Harrison stresses the importance of keeping bones away from your pets when prepping your holiday feast. She says vets commonly see "a lot of obstructions" from ham, turkey and chicken bones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only are they considered choking hazards for your dogs and cats, but they can cause blockage "if they can't pass through the intestines or the stomach," she says. In addition to obstruction, Dr. Harrison warns that bones can get stuck in their chins or jaws.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've seen someone's [pet] fracture their jaw based on chewing very hard bones," she shares, also noting that "cracked teeth" are also a possibility since some animals' teeth "aren't as strong or as strong as that bone" they are biting.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keep-candles-away-from-your-pets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keep candles away from your pets</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dog at Christmas table.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Candles can be hazardous for both humans and pets if not handles with care. While Dr. Harrison doesn't suggested avoiding candles completely, she advises to keep them "at a height where they can't be disturbed by the pets."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For dogs, Dr. Harrison says "happy tails" can easily knock over a candle. Therefore, she suggests placing it in a location away from the pup's wagging to avoid a fire hazard. For cats, she warns of whisker burns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My first cat I ever owned burned his whiskers on a candle that I had lit," Dr. Harrison recalls of her 9-year-old self at the time. "I learned I probably shouldn't have that candle because that cat is curious and will stick their face there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fortunately, Dr. Harrison says her cat was fine because she was there to take action; though she warns if she wasn't, "that absolutely could have caused burns to the pets as well as damage to the quarters where she lived."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pets can be tempted to put their faces close to candles due to their aromatic scents. "They smell so good some dogs will try and eat it and then that can make them very sick, so those are also the things that we should all be mindful of," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keep-tinsel-ribbon-and-string-out-of-your-pets-reach></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keep tinsel, ribbon and string out of your pet's reach</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cats wrapped in Christmas garland.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many holiday decorations use to wrap presents or adorn Christmas trees — like tinsel, ribbon and string — can be commonly mistaken for pet toys. If swallowed, Dr. Harrison says "they can really cause severe injury to the intestinal tract."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When injected, she says the string-like items can be hazardous to the pets' intestine and bunch up like an accordion as it starts to "bunch in there and get really taut" in the body. While she says it won't necessarily show up in an X-ray, there are other signs to be aware of like "vomiting, diarrhea and lethargy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you start to see those things, it's really important that you take them to the vet right away and exercise caution," Dr. Harrison says. She also lists stockings as decorations to "keep up and away" from your pets, especially if objects are handing out of them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Harrison emphasizes the importance of using "positive reinforcement," like having safe toys for your pets to play with instead. "If you see them playing with the tinsel or the ribbon just immediately replace it with something else," she suggests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elevate-tiny-toys-that-may-be-pet-choking-hazards></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Elevate tiny toys that may be pet choking hazards</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dog and Christmas presents by tree.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just as adults are mindful of their little ones swallowing tiny toys, Dr. Harrison says the same precautions should be taken for their fur babies as well. "I've removed so many toys from dogs and cats," she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They absolutely can have choking and blockages similar to our children or kids, so it's best to make sure that we keep those pets away from those toys," she advises. "So if you have a certain room that has toys laying on the floor, you've got to shut the door."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Harrison also stresses guardians inform their children as an early age about the importance of picking up after themselves. "We've got to keep everybody involved to make sure that we're picking up toys when we're done playing with them and putting them away so that our pets can stay safe," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But ingesting tiny toys isn't the only concern pet owners should put on their radar. Dr. Harrison says that stepping on them can cause "lacerations and puncture wounds" on their tiny little paws, too!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So, it's not just about eating them," she makes clear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-provide-a-calm-space-for-your-pet-amid-loud-crowds></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Provide a calm space for your pet amid loud crowds</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dogs by Christmas tree.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">'Tis the season to be jolly! Though, the excessive crowds and extra-loud noises might make your pet uncomfortable because Dr. Harrison says "they can get anxiety during these times," too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some animals might react differently around crowds and change, like "hiding from certain activities" or "expressing new behaviors." Therefore, she says "sticking to a routine is key," like "making sure you feed them and play with them at their usual times."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Dr. Harrison says that it is possible to have pets around for holidays "just fine," she highlights the importance of owners being "mindful and knowledgeable" of ways to decrease their pets' stress if needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Always provide a place for peace. Give them some place where they can go and feel safe, where they can be alone, where there's not a lot of commotion," she says. "Always make sure that they have food, water, or a litter box if it's a cat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If new people are entering your home, Dr. Harrison says to "keep introductions very casual," especially if they are unfamiliar with the house guests. She advises against "throwing your pet into the excitement."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-let-your-pet-drink-the-water-from-real-christmas-trees></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't let your pet drink the water from real Christmas trees</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kitten eating a Christmas tree branch.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless if your Christmas tree is real or fake, Dr. Harrison says the prickly pine needles that fall on the floor "can be agitating" for a pets' paws. Keep on top of sweeping and vacuuming to prevent your pet from stepping on them around the tree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have a real Christmas tree, Dr. Harrison says it's important to be mindful of the water at its base since most of them are treated with chemicals to keep the tree green. "If that pet goes in there and tries to drink that water, it can be toxic," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If the pet does have access to the water under the tree, just make sure you're using clean, fresh water with no preservatives or no chemicals," Dr. Harrison explains. "Change it daily."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-dangle-christmas-tree-decorations></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't dangle Christmas tree decorations</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cat playing with red ornament on Christmas tree.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like us humans, fury friends will also be taken by the shiny ornaments and decorations on the tree. "These all look like a playground for most of our pets," says Dr. Harrison. "They're naturally curious."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Harrison says string lights and other dangling objects are among the decorations to be mindful of when adorning your Christmas tree or furniture around the house. Keeping ornaments off the lower branches and placing them higher up is a tip she suggests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Eventually the novelty will wear off," she says of the period after first introducing the exciting new objects to your pets.

She recalls having had a few frustrated owners who were left with damaged packaging after their pets "got ahold of the chocolates that were under the tree."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keep-poisonous-plants-away-from-your-pets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keep poisonous plants away from your pets</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cat look at a Christmas mistletoe.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to safety precautions taken around chemicals in real Christmas trees and the water they sit in, Dr. Harrison says there are certain holiday plants that are naturally toxic and should be kept away from pets overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Poinsettias are extremely toxic to pets so I would avoid it all costs or put it up very, very high up so that they can't get to it," she says, adding that mistletoe and pine needles can also "cut their mouths" because they are sharp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If pine needles are ingested absolutely they can be dangerous and even sometimes deadly," Dr. Harrison says. "Just imagine your intestines are kind of like a rope and when you try and fit something in there it can get blocked and that can become very severe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-118 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, Dr. Harrison warns of holly's toxicity, in addition to mistletoe.
