He has a twin brother named Joey, born only a few minutes before him.</p><p>Before them, his parents, Joseph “Joe” and Rose Graham had given birth to their eldest brother, Brian.</p><p>Born in Delaware, his family later settled in Florida, so he grew up near Hillsborough Country in Florida.</p><p>His father, Joe, was a pilot and worked as a US Navy officer for many years. Their father introduced his children to many interesting things when they were kids. The twin brothers first consciously enjoyed their flight when they were just five.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stephen-Graham-with-his-twin-brother-Joey-1.jpg><p>Joe had wanted to become a professional basketball player during his school years. However, he had given up after not making it to his high school team. Consequently, he chose to go to military service.</p><p>But, he instilled his love and passion for basketball in his kids. Besides basketball, they played football and showed they could learn the game pretty fast.</p><p>Apart from games and studies, watching movies, and talking about jets and airplanes with their parents, were their favorite activities in childhood.</p><p>After graduating from Brandon High School in 2002, Stephen and Joey initially joined the University of Central Florida in Orlando. However, he later graduated with a degree in aviation management from Oklahoma State University.</p><p>Unlike Stephen, Joey had no intention of being a professional basketball player. He wanted to be a fighter jet pilot. But, he later joined his twin brother in the NBA after he failed to get into the military because of overheight.</p><h2>Stephen Graham | Basketball Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Stephen Graham played high school basketball for the Brandon School for four years. The head coach Mark Herman was impressed with his style of play from the start, and as a result, Graham became the team’s main guard in school.</p><p>During the same time, he played the AAU tournaments for two different teams, including Nike’s Traveling Florida team. He fit well into the forward position too, but he mainly played as a guard until he finished college.</p><p>For his performance in his junior season, he was named to Hillsborough County’s All-Conference team. In his senior year, the team management appointed him as captain, and he led Brandon to the state finals.</p><p>He received one more honor for his performance in the last season, All-State Team. He had finished his senior season with an average of 16.0 points, 6.0 assists, and 8.0 rebounds per game.</p><p><a href=#>Click here to learn about <strong>Jason Kidd</strong>, a former NBA player and current head coach of the Dallas Mavericks who won the NBA championships twice in 2011 and 2020!</a></p><h3>College Career</h3><p>After graduating high school, Stephen and his brother joined the University of Central Florida and committed to play for their basketball team, UFC Knights. He played two seasons for the Knights before transferring to the Oklahoma State Cowboys.</p><p>After shifting to the Oklahoma State Cowboys, Graham redshirted the 2002-03 season. In his junior year, the team management included him in their team, but he had very little playtime.</p><p>As a result, his performance was minimal, in which he averaged 2.8 points and 1.4 rebounds per game. He got more opportunities in the last college season, but he had weak stats, which left him little chance of getting drafted in the upcoming draft.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>When Stephen declared to go for the NBA draft in 2005, it was already quite evident that he would not get picked. However, his brother performed well in college and easily got into the NBA.</p><p>The Phoenix Suns called him and took him for the 2005 Las Vegas Summer League. He later played some preseason matches for the San Antonio Spurs, but none of these clubs offered him a contract.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stephen-Graham-with-the-New-Jersey-Nets-1-e1653047727191.jpg><p>It was his first-ever NBA regular-season experience. While he was happy to appear in major league matches, Graham’s performance was utterly disappointing. He had averaged 2.8 points and 1.2 rebounds in 6.3 minutes per game.</p><p>Stephen started getting some stability while with the Pacers. Although he primarily played as a substitute, he stayed with them for almost two years, and he played 74 NBA regular-season matches with them.</p><p>Besides playing basketball league in America, Stephen Graham played Puerto Rican BSN League and Venezuelan Superliga before retiring in 2013. He has already worked as an assistant coach for the clubs such as Fort Wayne Mad Ants and the Denver Nuggets.</p><h2>Net Worth & Career Earnings</h2><p>One of the former NBA players, Stephen Graham, has a net worth ranging from $1 million to $5 million.</p><p>Stephen started his professional career playing minor season and preseason matches for some NBA clubs. So, he did not have good earnings initially. After signing with the Houston Rockets in 2006, the club paid him around $48k.</p><p>He later signed with the Portland Trail Blazers for the 2007-08 season, for which they paid him a little more than $250k. Stephen’s salary somewhat increased as he began to get offers from other NBA clubs.</p><p>However, he could not perform as expected, so he never earned a million-dollar mark from a single season in his NBA career. After playing two seasons for the Indiana Pacers, he earned about $1.5 million.</p><p>He made some $1.7 million more from his remaining games in the NBA until 2011. Altogether, he has accumulated approximately $3.7 million from his NBA career.</p><p>Besides, he made some more money playing in the NBA G League and foreign league games in his active years.</p><p><a href=#>The Egyptian-American small forward <strong>Abdel Nader</strong> is a young professional basketball player who has already appeared in the NBA and NBA G League.
