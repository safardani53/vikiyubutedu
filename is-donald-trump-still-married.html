She didn't seem to accompany him to New York for his arrest and arraignment. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>During the course of <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>'s presidency, as well as the years following it, much has been revealed about the former president. Despite his numerous legal issues, Trump is still one of the biggest names in the political sphere, and he has plans to make another bid at the White House in 2024. Legally, he is still able to run, despite his status as the <a href=#>first U.S. president in history to be arrested</a> and charged with a crime (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">or 34</a>).</p><p>Speaking of legal issues, in June 2023, the Department of Justice indicted Trump on "seven counts in the special counsel’s classified documents probe," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>. Throughout all this, Melania Trump has been suspiciously absent from her husband's side. Is Donald Trump still married to the former first lady? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">With yet another indictment dropping, is Donald Trump still married to Melania?</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, Trump is still married to Melania and has been since 2005. In March 2023, a "Manhattan grand jury voted to indict him on criminal charges over the hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 presidential election," via the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>. Melania stayed out of the public eye during this time, which led to speculation about the status of their union.</p><p>Reportedly, Melania has been quite angry with her husband over the <a href=#>Stormy Daniels</a> drama. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that while Trump and Melania are still very much together, she "is leading her own life, and still feels happy being at Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by people who love her and who never talk about reality or bad things about her husband."</p><p>Another sign things may be rough between them is that when Trump spoke on stage at Mar-a-Lago on April 4, 2023, he shouted out his kids but didn't mention Melania, and she didn't seem to be present for that speech either, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>. Perhaps she finally began to feel pressure to respond because a week later, Melania released a statement addressing the rumors that she was unhappy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Melania Trump's statement didn't actually say much.</h2><p>In a statement obtained by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a> via the former first lady's office, Melania tried to squash the gossip about her marriage, kind of. "News organizations have made assumptions about the former First Lady’s stance on subjects that are personal, professional, and political over the past few weeks," the statement said. "In these articles, unnamed sources are cited to bolster the author’s claims." The statement urged folks to disregard anything that doesn't come directly from Melania.</p><p>"We ask readers to exercise caution and good judgment when determining whether or not stories concerning the former First Lady are accurate, particularly when they fail to cite Mrs. Trump as a source of information," the statement reads. The status of her marriage wasn't clarified, but the message is clear. If she didn't say it, it didn't happen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Melania Trump was spotted in New York City the same day Donald Trump was indicted, again.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a>, Melania stepped out in New York City on June 8, the day Trump was indicted regarding the classified documents he was keeping hostage at Mar-a-Lago. While we don't know where she was headed, we do know what she was wearing. The former first lady was sporting a Chanel bag and ballet shoes. It should be noted that the air quality was incredibly poor that day, due to the wildfires raging in Canada.</p><p>Prior to this outing, Melania was also "spotted at Mar-a-Lago with the ex-president on Mother's Day and on May 6, when she, her husband, and their son Barron met boxer Mike Tyson," per The Daily Mail. Remember when Mike was convicted of and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went to prison for raping Desiree Washington</a>? We do. Anyway, Melania also had brunch with her husband on Easter Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusM6nmKWcXam%2FtrnPZqqtoZyheq6t0augnpw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-donald-trump-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-donald-trump-still-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-donald-trump-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-donald-trump-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-donald-trump-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-donald-trump-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./colour-expert-what-your-cars-paint-says-about-you.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./colour-expert-what-your-cars-paint-says-about-you.html>Here's what your cars paint says about you - are you an owl, chilli or a heron?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./summer-i-turned-pretty-season-2-scene-hints-at-major-season-3-moment.html>Summer I Turned Pretty' Season 2 Scene Hints at Major Season 3 Moment</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./summer-i-turned-pretty-season-2-scene-hints-at-major-season-3-moment.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
