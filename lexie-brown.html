She has two sisters, <strong>Alyssa</strong> and <strong>Alanni</strong>, and a brother named <strong>Anakin</strong>. Sadly, anything other than their names is unknown at the moment.</p><p>But we do want to believe that the siblings are athletically gifted like Lexie herself. More even when considering how her father, Dee, is a former NBA player himself.</p><p>Likewise, Lexie’s father played professionally for numerous clubs like Jacksonville (1986-90), Boston Celtics (1990-98), Toronto Raptors (1998-2000), and Orlando Magic (2000-02).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lexie-001.jpg><p>Currently, Mr. Dee serves as a General Manager of the Agua Caliente Clippers and Director of Player Programs with the Los Angeles Clippers.</p><p>On the other hand, her mother, Tammy, was also an athlete and played college basketball and even an international level too.</p><p>Moving on, Lexie Brown went to North Gwinnett before getting transferred from Dr. Phillips. After that, she enrolled at the University of Maryland and later moved to Duke University.</p><p>From there, she earned her degree in sociology, along with a market and management certificate.</p><p>Also, Brown graduated from the Duke Fuqua School of Business back in 2018.</p><p>Similarly, Brown is an American-born athlete and belongs to the African-American ethnicity. As for her religion, the details are unknown.</p><h2>Height and Body Measurements- How Old Is Lexie Brown?</h2><p>Agile and stunning, Lexie Brown is the one to watch out for this season.

The young player stands at 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) and weighs around 68 kg (150 lbs).</p><p>Moreover, with years of training on the court, Lexie has achieved a toned physique yet an agile movement. But the exact measurements are still unknown.</p><p>Also, she has long black hair and stunning black eyes. When she is not playing, Brown makes sure to flaunt them.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Lexie Brown has been playing for Minnesota Lynx since her WNBA draft in 2018. Even though she is earning an impressive amount, her net worth at the moment is under review. But we are sure it is somewhere around the five-digit numbers.</p><p>Similarly, Brown is currently under a 4-year contract with the Minnesota Lynx worth <strong>$191,720</strong>. Also, it includes an annual average salary of <strong>$47,930.</strong></p><p>Moreover, as per the deal, Lexie will make <strong>$44,273</strong> as her base salary.

Despite that, we can clearly see that Brown is interested in fashion but still spends little on her attire.</p><h2>Lexie Brown- Early Basketball Career</h2><p>Before she made it in as a WNBA player, Lexie served her freshman season at Dr. Phillips, located in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>She helped the team achieve its first-ever undefeated regular season before being transferred to North Gwinnett in Suwanee, Georgia.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Brown enrolled at the University of Maryland. In her freshman year, she earned the nickname “<strong>Big Shot Brown”</strong> after leading her team to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lexie-002.jpg><p>That season, she was also named to the ACC All-Freshmen Team and ACC All-Academic Team.

She truly shined in the new team, where she scored career-high 21 points on <i>June 8</i>. Truly, Brown is shining in her blue jersey with the number 4 on it.</p><h2>Is Lexie Brown In a Relationship?- Personal Life</h2><p>Even though she has shined as a guard for the Minnesota Lynx, she has not exposed much of her personal life to the public. And it is making the public curious and keener about her dating life.</p><p>However, the 27 years old WNBA player seems to be single at the moment. She has not dropped any hints regarding her love life; as a matter of fact, Lexie has never been spotted with a man.</p><p>Talking about it, we are not even sure about her sexual preference. But being in a relationship seems to be the last thing in her mind right now.</p><p>Since making her WNBA debut two years ago, Lexie has been more lenient about causing rumors and keen on making records.</p><p>Nonetheless, Brown is a confident woman and never fails to give her all inside the court. She loves spending time with her family and friends.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Reimann Age, Height, Parents, Engagement, Husband, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>In an interview with WNBA, Lexie Brown described herself as super competitive, funny, and bossy.
