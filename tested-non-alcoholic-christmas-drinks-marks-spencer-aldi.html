leading me to believe it was non-alcoholic.</p><p>I much preferred the flavour of the non-alcoholic version and as a self-confessed gin hater, would much rather reach for it over a normal gin but that being said, it means it doesn't taste much like gin at all.</p><p>The price is a little steep for a non-alcoholic version, being just £5 cheaper, but the flavour is definitely worth it.</p><ul><li>Taste 3/5</li><li>Price 3/5</li><li>Total 6/10</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aldi prosecco</h2><p><strong>Aldi Castollore Organic Prosecco 750ml 11.5% ABV £7.99</strong></p><p><strong>Costellore Zerozecco 75oml 0% ABV £2.99</strong></p><p>Whether you want a straight up glass of prosecco or a bucks fizz -
