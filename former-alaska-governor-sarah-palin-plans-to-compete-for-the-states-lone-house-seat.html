After the death of the Republican Party’s longest-serving Congressman, Don Young, last month, the seat became vacant.&nbsp;Palin announced her candidacy on Twitter, saying she would be pleased to serve the people of Alaska. Her tweet stated:</p><p>Sarah Palin said in her announcement that she is aware of the obligations of her candidacy and is prepared to honor Representative Young with her efforts. She said,</p><p>“I recognize that I have extremely large shoes to fill, but I want to honor Representative Young’s legacy by sacrificing myself in the name of service to the state he loved and fought for, because I share his passion for Alaska and the United States of America.”</p><p>The former Republican Vice Presidential candidate went on to attack her opponents and address topics such as “out-of-control inflation,” “empty shelves,” and high “gas costs.”</p><p>She said, ”</p><p>“America has reached a tipping point.” As I saw the extreme left devastate the nation, I felt I had to take a stand and join the battle… We need energy security in this nation, and Alaska can help give it – but only if the federal government gets out of the way and allows the free market to do its thing.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Join our campaign -> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/CrlfiG8MJn</a></p><p>“Today I’m announcing my candidacy for the U.S. House seat representing Alaska. Public service is a calling, and I would be honored to represent the men and women of Alaska in Congress, just as Rep. Young did for 49 years.” – SP <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pdMpeDGlRV</a></p><p>— Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2022</a></p><p>Palin also said that she is now in a race with other “patriots” to “rescue the nation.” She continued,</p><p>“I’m in this race to win it and join the struggle for liberty with other patriots prepared to give everything to defend our nation.”</p><p>Sarah Palin’s decision to run for Congress signals her comeback to politics more than a decade after resigning as Governor of Alaska in 2009.</p><h2>A Look at Sarah Palin’s political career and departure.</h2><p>Sarah Palin was initially elected to the Wasilla City Council in 1992, and she was elected mayor in 1996. In 1999, she stood for re-election and beat incumbent John Stein for the second time. Palin was elected President of the Alaska Conference of Mayors in 1999.&nbsp;Palin was named head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission after an unsuccessful race for lieutenant governor in 2003. Between 2003 through June 2005, the politician was one of three directors of Ted Stevens Excellence in Public Service, Inc., a non-profit organization that offers political training to Republican women in Alaska.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Sarah-Palin-2.jpg alt="Sarah Palin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Palin was elected Governor of Alaska in 2006, becoming the state’s youngest governor and the first woman to hold the role. She rose to prominence in politics after serving as Republican presidential contender John McCain’s running mate in 2008.&nbsp;However, the two were defeated by Obama-Biden in November of that year, and Sarah Palin resigned as Governor of Alaska in 2009. Palin told ABC News a few months after she resigned that she was taken aback by the media’s reaction to her choice.</p><p>She said that she did not anticipate her departure to be a “big issue,” and she could not understand why the general public was “confused” about the matter. She said,</p><p>“Do you know why they’re perplexed?” I think people can’t accept anything at face value these days.”</p><p>Palin also said that “legal costs” were a big factor in her decision to leave the government in the aftermath of suspected ethical allegations leveled by her opponents. She said, ”</p><p>“You know, things in Alaska’s political arena have truly shifted since August 29, when I was nominated to run for Vice President.”&nbsp; When the opposition research began – those researchers really assaulted Alaska – they began digging for dirt and have not stopped. They aren’t going to discover any dirt.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Sarah-Palin-3.jpg alt="Sarah Palin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The former Alaska Governor also discussed escalating personal and state spending. She continued,</p><p>“We keep showing that every time we win an ethical violation litigation, and we’ve won them all.” However, it has cost our state millions of money. Todd and I have paid for it. You know the enemy would love to see us declared bankrupt so that we can’t afford to flee.”</p><p>Sarah Palin also stated that the prospect of being a “lame duck” after announcing her intention not to pursue a second term as governor pushed her to leave.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Joining other Masked alumni tonight to shout Thank You to all of the nation’s frontline crisis workers. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheMaskedSinger</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#ThanksYou</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/fv7tWphC2R</a></p><p>— Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2020</a></p><p>At the time, she also said that she was “very satisfied” with her replacement, Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell and that it was “the right thing for Alaska.” Sarah Palin, who just returned to politics, will have stiff competition in her latest congressional bid. According to reports, over 40 candidates have already applied for the open special election. The extraordinary primary election is set for June 11. The top four vote-getters will then be eligible to run in the extraordinary general election on August 16. According to reports, the winner will be decided by ranked-choice voting and will only serve for the remaining months of Young’s tenure.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidqKqdmr9urcuaqqSZXZy8t7HRp6arZaOWv6K0jKmYpaGeYr2trc2sZK2nXZi8rrzErZxmnp%2BnerW0xGaqrZmkmsBuuM6nnGagn6rApnnSnpitZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fformer-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-plans-to-compete-for-the-states-lone-house-seat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fformer-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-plans-to-compete-for-the-states-lone-house-seat.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fformer-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-plans-to-compete-for-the-states-lone-house-seat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fformer-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-plans-to-compete-for-the-states-lone-house-seat.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fformer-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-plans-to-compete-for-the-states-lone-house-seat.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fformer-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-plans-to-compete-for-the-states-lone-house-seat.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jose-da-silva.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jose-da-silva.html>Jose da Silva (canoeist)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./molly-tuttle.html>Fame | Molly Tuttle net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./molly-tuttle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
