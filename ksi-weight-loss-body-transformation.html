<time>04 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#>KSI</a> initially started as a YouTuber.</p><p>But now, he is not only an entrepreneur but also a boxer. It all started with his first amateur boxing fight against British YouTuber Joe Weller.&nbsp;</p><p>He competed in two more boxing matches against American YouTuber <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Logan Paul</a>, the second of which was a professional match.</p><p>On August 27, 2022, he competed in two exhibition boxing matches, both of which he won by KO, against British rapper Swarmz and Mexican boxer Luis Alcaraz Pineda.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He defeated FaZe Temperrr in an exhibition boxing match on January 14, 2023, via KO in the first round. He faced Joe Fournier in an exhibition boxing match on May 13, 2023, which was reversed from a KO win to a no-contest when a review revealed he accidentally punched Fournier with his elbow.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 14, 2023, KSI will face British professional boxer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tommy Fury</a>. Throughout his journey as a boxer, KSI has shown an incredible body transformation.</p><p>From his weight loss journey to complete body transformation —&nbsp;KSI has inspired his fans and followers to be healthy through workout routines and diet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>KSI’s weight loss and body transformation</h2><p>KSI’s weight loss and body transformation journey started when he decided to be a boxer. It especially started during his match with Paul.</p><p>Since then, there have been various fluctuations regarding his weight. When he is not boxing or taking a break from matches, there has been an increase in weight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, if there is a match, KSI follows a strict workout routine and diet, eventually resulting in weight loss. All the time, he has shocked people with his body transformation.</p><p>Currently, he is training hard and has appeared shredded. As said before, all of this weight loss and body transformation started when he boxed Paul in 2019.</p><p>He talked about boxing with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Men’s Health</a> in December 2019 where he said that the sport changed his life. He said, “Boxing has changed me so much, man. Maturity-wise, mentally, physically—it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>He also claimed that he was not boxing for money and fame, but instead, he did it for inspiration.</p><p>“All of the boxing purists, they think I was just doing this for money and fame and clout, nah man. Your boy did this for inspirations. And just for myself as well, man. To prove that I can overcome the odds as the underdog to defeat him when everyone counted me out, there’s no better feeling,” he said.</p><p>In 2022, KSI showed an incredible weight loss within a couple of months. In January 2022, he weighed 215lbs, and by August 2022, he weighed 182lbs —&nbsp;amounting to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">33lbs</a> of weight loss.</p><p>He also shared his impressive transformation on TikTok, leaving his fans and followers in awe of his weight loss and dedication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/KSI.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">KSI has had an incredible weight loss journey and body transformation with a workout routine and diet. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>He talked about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transformation</a> with Men’s Health the same month. He confessed that he was someone who did not enjoy workout routines or training.</p><p>However, he worked really hard for weight loss and managed to have an incredible transformation.</p><p>He said, “I started as someone that hated training. I hated exercise when I was in school. I wasn’t really the type of guy that liked to do anything physical, so I imagine a lot of people from school would be surprised to see me in the ring boxing, but it’s been a journey. I’ve just been working on my body.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He also did not have a single rest day. He said, “This has been the year where I decided to really make training a lifestyle, so yeah, I pretty much train every day.”</p><p>His body transformation had a good effect on him —&nbsp;both mentally and physically. KSI joked that he felt like a God and “very different to everyone else.”</p><p>He said this was because he was “super fit and super ready.” He was so impressed by his weight loss journey and transformation that he would stare at himself in the mirror.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He said, “I look at myself in the mirror, and I just stare at myself for five minutes, just being like ‘Jesus Christ. I’m sick.’ But I’ve worked hard for it. I’ve worked really hard for it, man.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>KSI’s workout routine and diet</h2><p>KSI’s incredible weight loss and body transformation were because of his workout routine and diet. He gave insights on his routine to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> in January 2023.</p><p>He claimed that he woke up at 8 A.M and had a proper diet breakfast by 8:30. After that, he went to the gym to follow up with his workout routine.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>There, he warmed up on the rowing machine for 100 calories, then did shadow boxing for four to six rounds. After that, he concentrated on technique, mobility, and things to work on in sparring before moving on to bag and pad work.&nbsp;</p><p>Then his workout routine entrailed some cardio on the versa climber possibly with a heavy ball. After that, he worked on his abs and headed back home for lunch.</p><p>Then, he took some rest by watching series and playing games. Then, he started his second session of his workout routine, which was on the track.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He used to run 400-meter sprints six times with one-minute breaks and aim to attain decent times. Then, he ended his workout routine with bunny hops.</p><p>His workout routine is always balanced with his diet. He often has proteins and a healthy diet to maintain his body transformation and weight loss journey.</p><p>For fight days, his diet is healthy yet heavy. He eats Kale frittata for breakfast, healthy tikka masala for lunch, and teriyaki salmon with sesame seeds for dinner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>KSI’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">diet</a> was more intense back in November 2019 when he was just starting out. His calories were kept around 2900 per day for his weight at the time.</p><p>He ate grass-fed meat, which had more vitamins B12, B3, and B6, as well as iron, selenium, and zinc. It also had more carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, which our bodies convert to vitamin A.</p><p>KSI also ate microgreens, fresh ginger, basil, turmeric, and pineapple. He ate protein pancakes or waffles for breakfast, eggs or fish for lunch, fresh fruit for snacks, and grass-fed beef, cod, or salmon with fresh vegetables and herbs for dinner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8qsoGavlZ60qcCMpaasq12XvKXFjK2pmqajm7yzucCtoKimXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fksi-weight-loss-body-transformation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fksi-weight-loss-body-transformation.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fksi-weight-loss-body-transformation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fksi-weight-loss-body-transformation.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fksi-weight-loss-body-transformation.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fksi-weight-loss-body-transformation.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kelsea-ballerini-hottest-red-carpet-looks-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kelsea-ballerini-hottest-red-carpet-looks-photos.html>Photos Of Her Outfits Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./haviland-stillwell.html>Haviland Stillwell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./haviland-stillwell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
