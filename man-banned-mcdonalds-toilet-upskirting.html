href=#>Derby</a> city centre found Asere Shumba hiding in one of the cubicles on December 28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/upskirt-pervert-derby-banned-entering-785770469.jpg><p>The 27-year-old had previously been barred from every one of the fast food chain's lavatories for taking photos of women in the toilets at a Maccies in <a href=#>Surrey</a>, <a href=# aria-label="DerbyshireLive (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DerbyshireLive</a> reports.</p><p>He was also found doing the same in the former Walkabout bar in Derby's Market Place.</p><p>Following the offences, an image of Shumba was distributed to restaurant workers as someone to keep an eye out for.</p><p>And, on Wednesday evening, one worker recognised him at the St Peter's Street outlet, Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court heard.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE UK NEWS">READ MORE UK NEWS</h2><p>In a statement, read out by prosecutor Becky Allsop, the employee said: "I recognised him and he followed me upstairs and made some conversation with me.</p><p>"I thought he was going to sit down and order some food but instead I watched as he walked into the female toilets."</p><p>A customer, who was in the bathroom at the time, said: "I think there's a male in one of the cubicles acting suspiciously."</p><p>She banged on the door and the defendant said: "What do you want?", to which they replied: "You are in the female toilets, you need to get out."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He claimed to have mistaken it for the men's toilets and left.</p><p>Shumba was later arrested at his home in Sinfin, where police seized devices to analyse.</p><p>He pleaded guilty to breaching the terms of a sexual harm prevention order, which was imposed in January 2021 at Derby Crown Court.</p><p>There, he admitted two counts of voyeurism and was handed a two-year community order.</p><p>These related to an <a href=#>upskirting</a> incident at a <a href=#>McDonald's</a> branch in Richmond, Surrey, and another in the old Walkabout bar, now called Hideout, on New Year's Eve 2019.</p><p>During the first, Shumba locked himself in a cubicle and filmed women as they used the facilities before being chased out by one of his victims, who said she felt "violated" by his behaviour.</p><p>One the second occasion, he was identified and arrested but managed to slip out of his handcuffs and make a run for it.</p><p>Officers managed to catch him and seize his phone, which held almost 400 upskirt-style photos.</p><h2>'YOU CLEARLY HAVE A PROBLEM'</h2><p>At the time, the judge said: "The offence of voyeurism is serious as it invades peopleâ€™s privacy and dignity.</p><p>"You recognised at the time it was morally wrong, but it is also illegal.</p><p>"You seem to have done this on a number of occasions, but I am only sentencing you for two.</p><p>"You clearly have a problem, but what drove you to do it is not entirely clear except you admitted yourself that you got sexual gratification from it."</p><p>Defending him this week, James Close said his client had completed the sex offender treatment programme required of him, as well as the necessary unpaid work.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He also said there was no evidence to prove Shumba had any recording devices on him during the latest incident.</p><p>Shumba was remanded into custody to be sentenced at Derby Crown Court on January 19.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What is upskirting and when did it become a criminal offence?</h3></p><p>UPSKIRTING typically involves someone taking a photo under another person's clothing without their knowledge or consent.</p><p>It became a specific criminal offence in England and Wales in April 2019 after a campaign from <a href=#>Gina Martin</a>, who experienced <a href=#>upskirting</a> at a music festival in 2017.</p><p>It is often performed in public places such as on transport, escalators and in crowds.</p><p>Victims are urged to seek support and contact police.</p><p>Perpetrators face two years in prison.</p><p>The most serious offenders are placed on the sex offenders register.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
