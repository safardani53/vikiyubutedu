One of them is his son, Alex.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Steve-Cooper-Carrying-A-Trophy-That-He-Won.jpg><p>Steve Cooper is a <a href=# rel=noopener>soccer manager</a> who was born in Pontypridd, Wales, on December 10, 1979. Although he was born in Pontypridd he later moved to nearby Hopkinstown with his family.&nbsp;</p><p>Cooper played as a defender for a number of Welsh clubs, notably Bangor City, while also studying for his coaching badges.</p><p>He took management of Wrexham and later Liverpool’s academies. He was one of the youngest coaches to receive his UEFA Pro License at the age of 27.</p><p>Furthermore, Cooper took over as manager of the England Under-16s in 2014, before moving on to the Under-17s a year later.</p><p>He led the team to the final of the 2017 UEFA European Championship but was beaten by Spain.</p><p>But they swiftly redeemed their loss over the Spaniards in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup final. Cooper joined Swansea City in June 2019 and led them to the 2020/21 playoff final.</p><h2>Steve Cooper Wife And Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Steve Cooper has been married to his wife for several years now but her name still remains a mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with The Athletic</a>, Cooper revealed details about his wife and children. The year was 2020 and Cooper was still managing Swansea during the time of the interview.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple have two children together who live with their mother. His wife and children were living in Wrexham, which is at the other end of the country from Swansea.</p><p>They were not living separately because of any kind of problems but because he had to work at Swansea.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Details-About-Steve-Cooper-Is-Not-Well-Known.jpg><p>Cooper loves having random conversations with his son Alex. He says that he frequently tries to inform his son regarding the negative side of social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Copper feels like Alex can be affected by the negative comments from fans and haters. Especially when the team’s performance is below acceptable levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Copper’s wife and children all support him very dearly without conditions. They even proudly wear the jerseys of Cooper’s teams despite the results.&nbsp;</p><p>Cooper says that he can relate to his children because even his father was once a soccer star.&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Keith Cooper, was a Premier League referee. Fans would often raw him into controversies because of his decisions. Yet Steve and the rest of the family always stood firmly by his side.&nbsp;</p><h2>Forest Has Sacked Cooper&nbsp;</h2><p>Nottingham Forest has sacked manager Cooper amid a challenging stretch this season. The sack comes after losing five of the last six games.</p><p>Owner Evangelos Marinakis, concerned about the team’s performance, made the decision on Tuesday.</p><p>Talks are ongoing with former Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo as a potential replacement.</p><p>Forest, currently 17th in the Premier League, won only once in the last 13 games, accumulating eight points.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Forest-Has-Recently-Sacked-Steve-Cooper.jpg><p>However, Fans have backed Cooper and Marinakis is facing a lot of criticism for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuno, previously with Wolves and Spurs, recently led Al-Ittihad to the Saudi Pro League title but was sacked in November.</p><p>Yet fan opinions still vary, with some supporting Cooper’s legacy, while others question Nuno’s potential appointment.</p><p>The team faces Bournemouth on Saturday, with fixtures against Newcastle United and Manchester United ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2F056tnmWTpLyxsdFmrqKelWK2tHnToZxmq5%2BYsKa%2BjKaYp5mXmr9uucCrqaKdlGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-cooper-wife-is-the-soccer-manager-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsteve-cooper-wife-is-the-soccer-manager-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsteve-cooper-wife-is-the-soccer-manager-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsteve-cooper-wife-is-the-soccer-manager-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-cooper-wife-is-the-soccer-manager-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-cooper-wife-is-the-soccer-manager-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-derek-luke-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-derek-luke-dating.html>Who is Derek Luke Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./erika-jayne-won-a-5-million-fraud-case-filed-by-her-ex-husbands-coworkers.html>Erika Jayne Won A $5 million Fraud Case Filed By Her Ex Husbands Coworkers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./erika-jayne-won-a-5-million-fraud-case-filed-by-her-ex-husbands-coworkers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
