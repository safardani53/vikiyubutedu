built Hollywood Cottage with the proceeds of a lucrative smuggling empire, but is serving a life sentence for the 1996 murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron during a row on the M25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000001353653.jpg><p>The 70-year-old used the mock-Tudor mansion - since renamed Oakwood House - to hide gold bullion stolen in the Brinks-Mat heist, and once intimidated neighbours by walking a pet LION in the estate's 20-acre grounds.</p><p>First listed for sale in December, the manor's centrepiece is a huge indoor pool with self-contained hot tub - surrounded by indoor palm trees, sofas, and a health suite containing&nbsp; a sauna and steam room.</p><p>Cops reckon more of the gold was hidden in a secret compartment beneath the 11-metre pool's tiles.</p><p>The house itself has five massive bathrooms, a tennis court, and a sleek modern kitchen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000344393728.jpg><p>The manicured grounds also boast a barn with three stables and a large child's play area - complete with a giant trampoline.</p><p>Outside is a three-car garage, with a patio terrace that overlooks the horse paddock and a huge greenhouse.</p><p>The first floor contains a small flat, with a fully-equipped kitchen and en-suite bathroom.</p><p>A second flat - with a kitchen, living area, bedroom and bathroom - can be found above the outdoor garage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000000210856.jpg><p>The huge barn can hold up to four horses - and above the stables are a games room, a snooker room, and a gym.</p><p>The estate&nbsp;is flanked by high walls and was protected by an elaborate network of CCTV cameras when Noye owned it.</p><p>High-strength security lights can light up the garden at a moment's notice.</p><p>In January 1985 a pair of undercover cops crept into the vast garden to investigate the £26m robbery - but were soon surrounded by Noye's three snarling rottweilers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000000136001.jpg><p>One of the officers escaped over the wall - but the other, DC John Fordham, was savagely attacked by the knife-wielding gang boss.</p><p>He was stabbed in the heart with such force that the blade severed a rib clean in two.</p><p>The detective died on the way to hospital with six separate knife wounds.<br><a href=#>Noye</a> later was found not guilty of murder after persuading a jury that he acted in self-defence.</p><p>But less than a year later he was back in the dock after melting down the stolen gold - some of which was found under his patio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000344574175.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The life and crimes of Kenneth Noye</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000304252429-e1522140648589.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>KENNETH Noye embarked on a life of crime at just three years old - when he was caught climbing trees to swipe apples from a neighbour's garden.</p><p>He soon graduated to playground bully at secondary school, fleecing lunch money from smaller boys by setting up a protection racket with his thuggish pals.</p><p>After a year spent in borstal when cops caught him shoplifting, Noye started a lucrative trade in selling stolen bikes - and was soon flogging whatever he could get his hands on.</p><p>A prolific thief throughout the early 1970s, he met his wife - a legal secretary - while waiting to speak to a barrister about charges of theft and assaulting a policeman.</p><p>In his early 20s, he realised there was more money to be made in selling rather than stealing the proceeds of robbery.</p><p>He soon developed a knack for fencing stolen goods - especially jewellery.</p><p>It was this knack that made him perfect to help the Brink's-Mat gang launder their stolen gold.</p><p>The scam - which involved setting up a smelter in a pal's basement - soon caught the attention of the Met's elite Flying Squad.</p><p>By the time DC John Fordham was stabbed in Noye's garden on a scouting mission, it was estimated that most of London's jewellery contained traces of Brink's-Mat gold.</p><p>Noye dodged jail by pleading self-defence - and blew kisses at jurors as he was allowed to walk free.</p><p>But he was eventually jailed after the murder investigation turned up evidence of the heist - including 11 gold bars hidden in his vast Kent mansion.</p><p>After an eight-year period in jail, Noye was back to his old tricks - narrowly avoiding arrest for his part in a £500,000 cocaine deal with the Miami mafia after a tip-off from a corrupt police officer.</p><p>But the law finally caught up with again when he was jailed for life after murdering motorist Stephen Cameron on the M25 in a road rage attack.</p><p>He was caged in 2000 after a year on the run in Spain - when he was finally caught by MI5.</p><p>Earlier this month he was moved to an open prison in Kent in perperation - despite being classed as one of the prison service's biggest escape risks.</p><p>Stunned cops told how Noye set up his record player to play the first bars of the Shirley Bassey song 'Goldfinger' when they walked into the vast sitting room.</p><p>A search of the mock-Tudor mansion turned up 11 bars of Brink's-Mat gold, a sackful of copper coins used in smelting, and a Guinness World Records book with the entry on the robbery circled.</p><p>Cops also came across a bedroom cupboard packed with leather bondage gear, along with sex aids and sado-masochistic porn films.</p><p>The fiend spat "I hope you all die of cancer" at jurors as he was sent down for 14 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000304252429-e1522140648589.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000001119473.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>He served just eight years behind bars before returning to a raucous party at Hollywood Cottage.</p><p>He flogged the estate for an estimated £1m shortly before <a href=#>murdering 21-year-old electrician Stephen Cameron</a> during a furious row on an M25 sliproad in nearby Swanley, Kent.</p><p>He reportedly made the decision to move after cops annoyed his wife by erecting a permanent - and frequently vandalised - memorial to DC Fordham at the end of their road.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kenneth Noye, road rage killer of Stephen Cameron on M25, to be transferred to open prison</span><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
